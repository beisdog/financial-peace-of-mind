Our Chief Investment Office (CIO) expects artificial intelligence (AI) to be one of the most important investment
opportunities of the decade. Our CIO expects high rates of investment to soon be followed by growth in
applications and expects companies across the AI value chain to generate more than USD 1.1 trillion in revenue
by 2027, five years after the onset of ChatGPT. Investors should focus on both listed megacaps and innovative
companies to capitalize.

Being invested in the right equities is therefore important and staying on top of the latest developments as
well as being flexible in the tech sector is a difficult task and hence we recommend delegating to the best
fund managers.

One of our solutions for a broad investment in the technology sector is the Polar Capital Global Technology Fund. This
solution offers the following characteristics:

• The fund invests in 60-85 technology stocks with a global multi-cap, growth centric approach, focused on winners
from technical disruption

• Stock-picking through an AI lens investing in the enablers and beneficiaries of artificial intelligence

• Theme-driven investment framework Active, bottom-up approach to portfolio construction

• Highly experienced, specialist team with dedicated investment professionals, one of the largest technology
investment teams in Europe

Risks: The fund invests in equities and is thus riskier than cash or bonds. The fund pursues an active management style,
with concentration risk in a specific sector, and hence performance can deviate substantially from the broad equity market.
Rapid changes in technology and/or government regulation of use in certain countries may affect the value of the Fund's
investments. The Fund may be less diversified than other investment funds. Additional information about these and other
risks can be found in the KID as well as in the prospectus of the fund. Past performance is no indication of future results.
