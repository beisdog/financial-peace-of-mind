Waxing Poetically

Solid results from MCW in 1Q, but the moderation in trends might limit the 
positive response
Overall, there was more good than not so good from Mister Carwash in 1Q. The 
company's comp of 6.0% nicely exceeded the consensus of 4.0%. This led to healthy 
EBIT dollar outperformance of 4.8% versus the consensus forecast of $62mm. Plus, it 
raised the low-end of its full year guidance to account for the 1Q outperformance. Yet, 
digging a little deeper, there were some notes of caution. The company's retail trends 
slowed sharply in April. Plus, the company moderated its expectations for both its retail 
demand for the next couple of quarters and its membership growth. 

� Net-net, there's a lot we like about its model in the current environment. It offers 
the surety of a subscription business with very little direct exposure to tariffs. Yet, 
the multiple expansion that the bull case is thirsty for might prove elusive until 
there's more evidence of the resilience of trends. With the shares trading at ~12x 
CY'25E EBITDA, we think the stock probably trades around the recent range for 
the near-term. We would look for a better window to be more aggressive with the 
shares. 

� Membership growth took a nice step up in 1Q: The company added 103k UWC 
members, equating to ~4.9% growth. Ultimately, the fuel that drives this business 
is membership growth. So, the fact that this metric was strong in 1Q supports the 
bull case. The growth was supported by double-digit retail growth in January. It 
faced an easier comparison the first month of the year and it also benefited from 
some favorable weather. Still, the retail business tends to be a top-of-funnel driver 
for MCW. 

� MCW's comp growth in 1Q continued to be supported by the Titanium 360 
rollout. The company will fully lap this deployment moving through 2Q. Yet, it is in 
the process of taking the price of its base membership from $19.99 to $22.99. The 
base membership accounts for 42% of its UWC memberships. Thus, it should 
have a nice hand from the moderation in the contribution of the titanium uptake 
to the benefit of the pricing change for its core program. 

� The company's 1Q EBIT of $65mm outperformed due in part to the leverage from 
the higher sales growth and a shift in advertising spend from 1Q to 2Q. This latter 
amount was around $1.5mm. We think it makes sense for the company to shift 
this spend. It had the benefit of seeing the strength in January. It was able to 
manage its operating expense accordingly. This is what good companies tend to 
do.

Mister Car Wash Inc 30 April 2025 ab 2

� The outlook now factors in a decline in its retail business of -HSD% and a slight 
moderation in its membership growth. We have taken our comp growth for 2Q to 
4Q from an average of 2.0% previously to 1.3% now. Further, this flows through 
to our EBITDA estimate, which now stands at $340mm for the full year versus 
$347mm previously. Given the 1Q outperformance, this means that our 2Q-4Q 
EBTIDA forecast declined modestly. Until estimates are consistently moving higher, 
the market probably will not assign a much higher multiple to the stock. 

MCW reported a 1Q comp of 6.0% (vs. UBSe 4.0%; cons. 4.0%)
MCW's 1Q sales growth of 9.4% (vs. UBSe of 7.5%; cons. of 7.8%) was driven by better 
than expected comp growth of 6.0% in 1Q (vs. cons. 4.0%; UBSe 4.0%), favorable 
weather conditions and new stores (opened 4 greenfields in 1Q). Further, MCW 
experienced a ~30-40 bps tailwind in 1Q from a favorable Easter timing shift. This will 
flip to a headwind of about 20-30 bps  in 2Q. By month, January was the strongest 
month of the quarter with total comp up low double-digit. February was weaker but still 
comp grew low single-digit and then March improved to mid-single digit comp growth.

� UWC added 103k net new UWC members YoY in 1Q and grew to 2.2mm total 
UWC members. This translated to roughly ~4.9% member growth YoY. UWC 
sales represented ~73% of total wash sales in 1Q, slightly down from ~74% last 
year. Importantly, MCW has now lapped the  platinum tier price rise to $32.99 from 
$29.99 in 40% of its stores during March 1 to April 1 (2024). The other 60% of 
stores had taken this price increase at the time of Titanium 360 launch in their 
respective market. While this revenue per member tailwind goes away, it is now 
raising the base membership price similarly to $22.99 from $19.99. It should be 
fully rolled out by June. Lastly, UWC membership mix was 42% base, 35% 
platinum and 23% Titanium in 4Q'24 (vs. 41% base, 36% platinum and 23% 
Titanium in 4Q'24). 

� Titanium 360 still presents some tailwinds from not having yet lapped promotions 
and price hikes.  MCW offered promotions to drive penetration to 24% in 3Q'24. 
Further, MCW raised the price of T360 to $39.99 from $36.99 for 20% of its 
member base in 2Q'24. By the end of 3Q'24, it stated the vast majority of its T360 
memberships recharged at the full regular monthly rate. So, there should be sales 
per member lift through 2Q'25 from not having lapped this price increase fully. 
Once this has lapped, MCW's base rate price hike will provide some support 
moving forward.  

MCW adj EBITDA increased 13.9% and margin was up ~369 bps  to 32.7%
MCW reported $85.6 mm adj. EBITDA and a 32.7% adj. EBITDA margin (up ~369 bps 
vs. ~97 bps in 4Q'24). This compared to consensus estimates of $82.2 mm adj. EBITDA 
and 31.9% adj. EBITDA margin and UBSe of $90.4 mm adj. EBITDA and 35.1% adj. 
EBITDA margin.

� Cost of labor and chemicals leveraged by -158 bps to 28.4% driven primarily by 
leverage on sales, efficiencies from optimized labor model and savings in chemical 
costs.

� Other store operating expenses (incl. of D&A) deleveraged by 144 bps to 41.9% 
driven by higher rent expense related to new store growth and sale leasebacks and 
higher utilities, equipment, facilities and maintenance cost. 

� Gross margin grew ~14 bps to 29.7% (vs. -49 bps to 28.9% in 4Q'24). Further, 
SG&A leveraged by ~-375 bps to 5.0% margin in 1Q (vs. ~-122 bps of leverage to 
6.1% in 4Q) driven primarily by better expense management. Keep in mind, MCW 
shifted roughly $1.5mm of planned marketing into 1Q from 2Q

MCW raised the low end of its revenue, comp sales growth and adj. EBITDA 
outlook
In 2025, MCW expects sales of $1,046mm to $1,064mm (up from $1,038mm on low 
end). This is driven by 1.5-3.0% comp growth (up from 1.0% on low end) and 30-35 
new greenfield openings. MCW embeds a cautious view of the consumer given the 
macro backdrop but also optimism about its business momentum. 

� Quarterly comparable sales  growth: MCW's comp outlook implies 2Q-4Q 
comp moderates to flat to down slightly by the end of the year at the low end and 
holds ~2.0% through the year at the high end. Keep in mind, while it laps 
tailwinds from price hikes in both premium and T360 in 2Q and into 3Q, its price 
hike on its base membership will support revenue per member growth in the back 
half of the year.



Mister Car Wash Inc 30 April 2025 ab 3

� UWC: MCW's outlook embeds mid-single digit member growth for the year and 
low single-digit comps to member growth. Moreover, it expects churn levels to be 
in line with where it ended 1Q. Lastly, it factored into its guidance a slight uptick in 
churn after the price hike for base members as it saw in testing. This uptick was 
short-lived and in line with expectations. 

� Retail trends: MCW lowered its retail comp guidance to down high-single digit 
for the full year, from down -MSD% previously. At the low end of its guidance, it 
assumes retail comp down low-double digit for the full year, consistent with early 
2024. 

� Greenfields: MCW anticipates opening 30-35 greenfields in 2025 still. 
Importantly, it expects 70% of the openings to occur in the back half of the year. 
We think this along with increased marketing spending should support retail and 
membership growth in the second half of the year.

How are bears reacting to the print?
Bearish investors have taken issue with softening in MCW's retail trends in April. Bears 
believe this is a signal of more pressure to come. Moreover, MCW stated it experienced a 
slight uptick in churn once it raised prices on base members. Bears think this price hike 
could lead to increased churn moving forward, especially if the impact of tariffs becomes 
more widely felt in the coming months. While people enjoy having a clean car, it is not a 
necessity. Discretionary auto part category sales have been under pressure for the past 
several quarters and levels of deferred maintenance remain high according to Big 4 auto 
part retailers. Overall, bears don't see these as good signs that MCW can effectuate 
consistent earnings growth momentum that will be needed to lift the multiple. All 
together, this feedback implies '26 EPS of approximately $0.44 and a roughly ~9x 
multiple. 

How are bulls reacting to the print?
On the other hand, the bulls were highly pleased with MCW's 1Q results. First, MCW's 
6.0% comp exceeded expectations. Next, a second consecutive quarter of positive retail 
comp growth is a strong sign of future UWC demand.  This strong membership growth 
in 1Q lent to MCW raising the low end of its outlook. Further, bulls believe competition 
is beginning to thin out in general. MCW's locations face comp pressure for 12-18 
months in general when new competing locations open nearby. Bulls estimate that the 
number of stores opening overall is estimated to be down roughly -25% YoY and down 
-50% on a 2-year stack. Bulls believe fewer competitor openings will drive better comp 
growth moving forward. In addition, bulls believe that promotion strategies are 
becoming more rational. Overall, this feedback implies approximately $0.60 EPS in '26 
and  a high double-digit multiple. 

Valuation: We view the stock’s risk/reward profile as balanced
Our PT of $8.25 (was $8.50) is based on ~16x (was ~17x) our CY'26E EPS estimate of 
$0.52 (was $0.51).  Currently, MCW is trading at ~15x its consensus NTM forward 
earnings (less than one SD below its 3-year historical average of ~25x). We slightly lower 
our multiple and PT alongside our reduced near-term estimates given the uncertainty 
ahead. That said, we slightly raise our 2026 estimates given strong 1Q results and our 
expectation that MCW will benefit from its growing scale and less new competitive 
threats over time.

KEY DEFINITIONS: Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over 
the next 12 months. In some cases, this yield may be based on accrued dividends. Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as 
the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a forecast of, the equity risk premium). Under Review (UR) 
Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are subject to possible change in the 
near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. Short-Term Ratings reflect the expected 
near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months.

EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES: UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors 
such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Sell: Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. Core 
Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review Consultation (IRC). 
Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's debt. As a result, stocks 
deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rating. When such exceptions apply, 
they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.

Research analysts contributing to this report who are employed by any non-US affiliate of UBS Securities LLC are not registered/
qualified as research analysts with FINRA. Such analysts may not be associated persons of UBS Securities LLC and therefore are not 
subject to the FINRA restrictions on communications with a subject company, public appearances, and trading securities held by a

The analyst(s) responsible for the preparation of this document may interact with trading desk personnel, sales personnel and other parties for the purpose of gathering,

For financial instruments admitted to trading on an EU regulated market: UBS AG, its affiliates or subsidiaries (excluding UBS Securities LLC) acts as a market maker or 
liquidity provider (in accordance with the interpretation of these terms in the UK) in the financial instruments of the issuer save that where the activity of liquidity provider is

Investing in structured investments involves significant risks. For a detailed discussion of the risks involved in investing in any particular structured investment, you must read 
the relevant offering materials for that investment. Structured investments are unsecured obligations of a particular issuer with returns linked to the performance of an 
underlying asset. Depending on the terms of the investment, investors could lose all or a substantial portion of their investment based on the performance of the underlying 
asset. Investors could also lose their entire investment if the issuer becomes insolvent. UBS does not guarantee in any way the obligations or the financial condition of any 
issuer or the accuracy of any financial information provided by any issuer. Structured investments are not traditional investments and investing in a structured investment is 
not equivalent to investing directly in the underlying asset. Structured investments may have limited or no liquidity, and investors should be prepared to hold their investment 
to maturity. The return of structured investments may be limited by a maximum gain, participation rate or other feature. Structured investments may include call features and, 
if a structured investment is called early, investors would not earn any further return and may not be able to reinvest in similar investments with similar terms. Structured 
investments include costs and fees which are generally embedded in the price of the investment. The tax treatment of a structured investment may be complex and may differ 
from a direct investment in the underlying asset. UBS and its employees do not provide tax advice. Investors should consult their own tax advisor about their own tax situation 
before investing in any securities.

Important Information About Sustainable Investing Strategies: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and incorporate environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) factors into investment process and portfolio construction. Strategies across geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. 
Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio manager’s ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise 
would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing 
considerations may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered by the portfolio manager, and the 
investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ.

Within the past 12 months UBS Switzerland AG, its affiliates or subsidiaries may have received or provided investment services and activities or ancillary services as per MiFID 
II which may have given rise to a payment or promise of a payment in relation to these services from or to this company.
