Trivago NV
Upward Revision to Guidance and Holisto on the 
Horizon

Key Takeaway
As Trivago's global footprint indexes higher towards Developed EU and ROW - travel 
demand on the aggregate remained strong through the first quarter and management 
noted it remains robust across all regions into April. More specifically, Dev EU and 
ROW demand is slightly up while the Americas are modestly down, as the inbound 
travel corridor from Canada and Mexico remains low, but on the aggregate continues to 
grow double digits so far in 2Q25.  And despite the tougher operating backdrop, the top 
and bottom line outperformance in the quarter provides us with another proof point 
that Trivago continues to see the returns on its brand marketing efforts.  Management 
offered revised FY25 guidance of revenue growth of mid-teens vs prior high single digits 
and positive Adj. EBITDA growth from"at least" break-even provided last quarter.  Our 
2025E revenue and Adj. EBITDA now stands at €553.6M/€14.8M vs €492.5M/€9.9M 
prior. We maintain our Neutral rating and raise our price target to $4. 

Upside Case
We think the bulls will argue: 1) DD growth in Jan continuing into Apr suggesting travel 
demand resiliency, 2) Despite the onset of a tougher macro towards the end of 1Q, 
Referral revenue in Rest of World +44%, Dev EU +19%, and Americas +18% YOY in the 
quarter, 3) Trivago's election to acquire the remaining interest in Holisto underscores its 
focus to drive brand traffic and its efforts to get users to book directly through Book & 
Go/Holisto should drive S&M leverage over the long-term.  

Downside Case
The bears may counter: 1) TRVG may be over indexing  towards brand channels which 
have shown to be volatile to macro changes, 2) Unfavorable operating environment 
particularly in the Americas may erode ROAS, 3) Even as it rolls out Book & Go, TRVG will 
likely continue to lose share to TRIP, which is attempting to redefine top of the funnel in 
travel with its GenAI trip planner, and 4) Mix of EXPE Referral revenue is down to 35% in 
2025 from 37% in 2024 suggesting unfavorable ROIs for larger OTA players. 

Valuation:
We raise our price target to $4 (from $3.4)  as we apply a 0.3x (from 0.2x) multiple on our 
2Q26-1Q27 revenue estimate of $661 million.

Investment Case: Upward Revision to Guidance 
and Holisto on the Horizon
Trivago reported 1Q25 Revenue and adjusted EBITDA of €124.1 million and (€6.5) 
million vs UBSe €111.3 and (€9.4) million. Our estimates for 2025 Revenue and Adjusted 
EBITDA now stand at €533.6 million and €14.8 million versus €496.1 million and €9.9 
million prior. 

Similar to Booking  -  in that Trivago's global footprint indexes higher towards Developed 
Europe and Rest of World - travel demand on the aggregate remained strong through 
the first quarter and management noted remains robust across all regions into April. 
More specifically, Dev EU and ROW demand is slightly up while the Americas are 
modestly down, as the inbound travel corridor from Canada and Mexico remains low, 
but on the aggregate continues to grow double digits so far in 2Q25.  And despite the 
tougher operating backdrop, the top and bottom line outperformance in the quarter 
provides us with another proof point that Trivago continues to see the returns on its 
brand marketing efforts.  As such,  management offered revised full year 2025 guidance 
of revenue growth of mid-teens vs prior guidance of high single digits and positive 
Adjusted EBITDA growth from"at least" break-even provided last quarter. 

Trivago also announced it had exercised its call option to acquire its remaining interest in 
Holisto. As a reminder, the company had paid $10 million for a 30% stake in Holisto on 
July 30, 2024 which implied a $33.3 million valuation, with the option to purchase the 
remaining 70% within 15 months for a maximum of $60 million. Terms of the deal 
includes a cash payout of $26 million and expected to close sometime in 2H25. As a 
reminder, our model had already assumed that Trivago would elect to acquire the 
remaining percentage and thus we update our model for the disclosed $26 million cash 
payment to occur in 3Q25.   Perhaps most importantly, management's revised full year 
outlook does not include contributions from Holisto which leaves room on the table for 
further upward estimate revisions to materialize in 2H. 

Global return on ad spend (ROAS) on the aggregate declined in the quarter to 118.1% 
from 119.2% in the year prior driven by the Americas which was down 11.8pts and Rest 
of World also down 4.8pts YOY. The shortfall was largely driven by Trivago's ongoing 
efforts to push its brand marketing investments to drive up direct traffic volume to the 
platform which resulted in revenue growth but at the expense of lower ROAS. 
Otherwise the shortfall was offset by Dev EU which was up 13pts over the same period.  

Reported revenue of €123.4 million delivered a beat vs the Street €112 million and UBSe 
€110.3 million driven by strength in referral revenue across all three regions. While 
aggregate operating expenses came in higher than we anticipated, the top line beat and 
subsequent flow through drove a modest profitability beat vs our expectations.    

As we flow through the quarter's outperformance, we revise higher our Referral 
revenue estimates globally - we also raise our OpEx as we contemplate higher sales and 
marketing expenses as the company continues to invest into its tech stack, AI/ML efforts, 
and brand advertising initiatives. As mentioned prior we also incorporate the cash 
impact from Trivago's election to acquire its remaining interest in Holisto. 

As a result, we maintain our Neutral rating but raise our price target to $4.0 from $3.4, 
with the key points of our investment thesis being: 

� The OTAs continue to decrease their reliance on Metasearch, shifting their spend 
towards merchandizing, loyalty, and Google. BKNG and EXPE accounted for 39% 
and 37% of TRVG Referral revenue in 4Q24. We model BKNG and EXPE growing 
marketing expenses by 3.8% and 3.8% respectively in 2025E and 6.1% and 6.7% 
in 2026E. From this growth, we believe Trivago will likely lose share given the 
volatility that they have seen in performance channels, as well as product 
innovation and optimizations in Tripadvisor.

Trivago NV 1 May 2025 ab 4

Valuation
We derive our updated price target of $4 from $3.4 based on an EV / revenue 
methodology as we apply a 0.3x multiple (from 0.2x) to our 12-months ending 1Q27E. 

We believe that our revised 0.3x EV/Revenue multiple is appropriate as the company 
begins to  see the returns on its  higher brand marketing outlay to accelerate revenue 
growth  in 2025 which we forecast to extend into 2026. Management's latest 2025 
revenue guidance calls for mid-teens growth vs its prior guidance of high single digits. 
We note that revenue declined 5% growth in 2024. Whereas we are now modeling 
+10.4% and +9.1% revenue growth in 2026 and 2027 which we believe justifies the 
higher multiple. Our updated multiple remains in line with the stock's historical 2-year 
trading average and within the 0.1x-0.4x range.

structurally more efficient marketing spend after streamlining the marketing approach, (2) 
failure to sustain fixed cost savings generated from the pandemic related restructuring, (3) 
loss of market share and/or OTAs shifting marketing budgets away from metasearch towards 
search or brand advertising channels, (4) Google pushing further into online travel, (5) 
pandemic waves and (6) macro economic risk.

Trivago NV 1 May 2025 ab 11

KEY DEFINITIONS: Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over 
the next 12 months. In some cases, this yield may be based on accrued dividends. Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as 
the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a forecast of, the equity risk premium). Under Review (UR) 
Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are subject to possible change in the 
near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. Short-Term Ratings reflect the expected 
near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months.

EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES: UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors 
such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Sell: Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. Core 
Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review Consultation (IRC). 
Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's debt. As a result, stocks 
deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rating. When such exceptions apply, 
they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.

Research analysts contributing to this report who are employed by any non-US affiliate of UBS Securities LLC are not registered/

future results. Transaction costs may be significant in option strategies calling for multiple purchases and sales of options, such as spreads and straddles. Because 
of the importance of tax considerations to many options transactions, the investor considering options should consult with his/her tax advisor as to how taxes 
affect the outcome of contemplated options transactions.

damage arising out of the use of all or any of the Information.

The analyst(s) responsible for the preparation of this document may interact with trading desk personnel, sales personnel and other parties for the purpose of gathering,

For financial instruments admitted to trading on an EU regulated market: UBS AG, its affiliates or subsidiaries (excluding UBS Securities LLC) acts as a market maker or 
liquidity provider (in accordance with the interpretation of these terms in the UK) in the financial instruments of the issuer save that where the activity of liquidity provider is

Investing in structured investments involves significant risks. For a detailed discussion of the risks involved in investing in any particular structured investment, you must read 
the relevant offering materials for that investment. Structured investments are unsecured obligations of a particular issuer with returns linked to the performance of an 
underlying asset. Depending on the terms of the investment, investors could lose all or a substantial portion of their investment based on the performance of the underlying 
asset. Investors could also lose their entire investment if the issuer becomes insolvent. UBS does not guarantee in any way the obligations or the financial condition of any 
issuer or the accuracy of any financial information provided by any issuer. Structured investments are not traditional investments and investing in a structured investment is 
not equivalent to investing directly in the underlying asset. Structured investments may have limited or no liquidity, and investors should be prepared to hold their investment 
to maturity. The return of structured investments may be limited by a maximum gain, participation rate or other feature. Structured investments may include call features and, 
if a structured investment is called early, investors would not earn any further return and may not be able to reinvest in similar investments with similar terms. Structured 
investments include costs and fees which are generally embedded in the price of the investment. The tax treatment of a structured investment may be complex and may differ 
from a direct investment in the underlying asset. UBS and its employees do not provide tax advice. Investors should consult their own tax advisor about their own tax situation 
before investing in any securities.

Important Information About Sustainable Investing Strategies: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and incorporate environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) factors into investment process and portfolio construction. Strategies across geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. 
Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio manager’s ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise 
would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing 
considerations may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered by the portfolio manager, and the 
investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ.

Within the past 12 months UBS Switzerland AG, its affiliates or subsidiaries may have received or provided investment services and activities or ancillary services as per MiFID 
II which may have given rise to a payment or promise of a payment in relation to these services from or to this company.
