Deal announcement likely holds the key to re-
rating

Deal timeline unchanged. Formal announcement will be a key catalyst
The completion of the ANH disposal remains the key catalyst for DSFIR in our view, with 
the broader macroeconomic environment  only adding to prior uncertainty surrounding 
the deal. While we are clearly in a buyers rather than a sellers market currently, the CFO 
mentioned during the Q1 conference call that the initial bids had been received, a 
shortlist had been drawn up for the progression to the due diligence stage and that the 
disposal process was on track to complete by 2025YE. It was also noted that DSFIR still 
intends to be able to announce the preferred bidder during the summer (i.e. June or 
July); as was previously communicated at the ESG Investor Event in March (link). There is 
clearly nervousness within the market more broadly that any M&A activity could be 
delayed (or pulled altogether) given the current macro backdrop and hence we do 
believe it will require the deal to be formally announced before the share price will react 
meaningfully positively. Under the assumption the deal announcement  materialises as 
communicated, however, that catalyst is now likely a maximum of 3 months away.

MSD% OSG in 'Remain Co' aligned with our expectations for F&F
One of the key arguments we heard from those investors more cautious on DSM-
Firmenich heading into the print, was that the 2025 organic sales growth (OSG) and 
volume prospects for the 'Remain Co' (i.e. the combination of P&B, TTH and HNC) 
compared unfavourably to key peers in 2025. This does not appear to be the case for 
Q1, with DSM-Firmenich reporting ~4.8% OSG (5.5% volumes, -0.7% pricing); 
modestly ahead of Symrise (4.2% OSG; 2.8% volumes; link) and what consensus 
expects from IFF (2.9% OSG, 2.4% volumes) which is due to report post-market next 
Tuesday (6 May); albeit slightly below the 7.4% OSG (6.0% volumes) reported by 
Givaudan (link). Similarly, for FY25, we model 5.2% OSG (5.2% volumes and 0% 
pricing) for DSFIR, which again appears in the middle of pack on OSG but at the top end 
of peers on volumes. We model 6.0% OSG at Givaudan (5.0% vols) and 5.3% OSG 
(3.9% vols) at Symrise; whereas cons is modelling 2.5% OSG (2.2% vols) for IFF. The 
CFO reiterated an expectation for MSD% OSG for these assets during the conference 
call.

Valuation:  PT cut by 2% to €120 on peer derating
We lower our 2025/26 adj. EBITDA estimates by 2%/3% post Q1 results; a summary of 
our estimate changes is inside. We lower our PT by 2% to €120 (from €122) due to our 
est. changes and recent peer valuation moves, which is reflected in our SOTP. Our 
valuation methodology of an equal-weighted blend of SOTP and DCF is unchanged.

Change to UBS estimates and PT
Below we summarise the key changes to UBS estimates.

Following the 1Q25 results, we lower our Q2 sales estimate by ~3% to €3,225m, 
primarily linked to a M2M for FX. Our Q2 OSG estimate is lowered  33bps to 6.2% (vs 
6.6% previously), albeit our ex-ANH, or 'Remain Co', OSG estimate actually increases 
30bps to 5.2% (vs 4.9% previously). The cut to our group OSG estimate reflects lower 
pricing assumptions in ANH, and to a lesser extent HNC, than we previously assumed 
related to the temporarily higher vitamin prices. Our Q2 adj. EBITDA estimate is lowered 
1.5% to €613m (€623m previously), with a higher margin assumption in the ANH  
division helping to partially offset the ~3% cut to our revenue  estimate. 

For  2025E, we decrease our sales estimate by ~2% to €12,873m with a larger FX 
headwind on sales than we previously modelled (-2% impact) and a 64bps lower OSG 
estimate of 5.2% (vs 5.9%) the key drivers of this cut. Our ex-ANH OSG estimate for 
2025 is 5.2% (vs 4.9% previously). Our 2025 adj. EBITDA estimate is decreased by ~2% 
to €2,431m (€2,469m previously), representing an EBITDA margin of 18.9% (vs 18.7% 
previously).

We lower our PT by 2% to €120 (from €122) to reflect our estimate changes and recent 
peer valuation moves, which is reflected in our SOTP. Our valuation methodology of an 
equal-weighted blend of SOTP and DCF remains unchanged.

Forecast excess return 23.4%

Company Description

DSM merged with Firmenich in early May 2023, creating a global leader in flavours and 
fragrances, animal nutrition and key ingredients for a range of human health products (such 
as vitamins, supplements and infant milk formula). DSM-Firmenich has communicated an 
intention to exit its Animal Nutrition & Health (ANH) division in 2025, which would leave 
DSFIR as a consumer end-markets pure play with three divisions; Perfumery & Beauty (P&B), 
Taste, Texture & Health (TTH) and Health, Nutrition & Care (HNC). The company has two head 
offices: one in the Netherlands and one in Switzerland.

Valuation Method and Risk Statement

Despite the Firmenich transaction a significant portion of DSM-Firmenich's normalised 
earnings (10-15% on our est.) is still subject to swings in selling price-to-raw material price 
discrepancies and supply/demand volatilities of capacity sensitive commodity product lines, 
including bulk vitamins. This however would disappear with the disposal of the ANH assets. 

Key downside risks include; 1) failing to deliver on the €350m synergies associated with the 
merger; 2) not delivering the €200m vitamins restructuring cost savings; or 3) failing to 
dispose of the ANH division which was announced in conjunction with the FY23 results.

We use an equal weighted blend of DCF and a SOTP valuation for our PT. We assume a WACC 
of 7.4% and terminal growth rate of 2.5%

KEY DEFINITIONS: Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over 
the next 12 months. In some cases, this yield may be based on accrued dividends. Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as 
the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a forecast of, the equity risk premium). Under Review (UR) 
Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are subject to possible change in the 
near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. Short-Term Ratings reflect the expected 
near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months.

EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES: UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors 
such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Sell: Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. Core 
Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review Consultation (IRC). 
Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's debt. As a result, stocks 
deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rating. When such exceptions apply, 
they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.

of the importance of tax considerations to many options transactions, the investor considering options should consult with his/her tax advisor as to how taxes 
affect the outcome of contemplated options transactions.

damage arising out of the use of all or any of the Information.

Investing in structured investments involves significant risks. For a detailed discussion of the risks involved in investing in any particular structured investment, you must read 
the relevant offering materials for that investment. Structured investments are unsecured obligations of a particular issuer with returns linked to the performance of an 
underlying asset. Depending on the terms of the investment, investors could lose all or a substantial portion of their investment based on the performance of the underlying 
asset. Investors could also lose their entire investment if the issuer becomes insolvent. UBS does not guarantee in any way the obligations or the financial condition of any 
issuer or the accuracy of any financial information provided by any issuer. Structured investments are not traditional investments and investing in a structured investment is 
not equivalent to investing directly in the underlying asset. Structured investments may have limited or no liquidity, and investors should be prepared to hold their investment 
to maturity. The return of structured investments may be limited by a maximum gain, participation rate or other feature. Structured investments may include call features and, 
if a structured investment is called early, investors would not earn any further return and may not be able to reinvest in similar investments with similar terms. Structured 
investments include costs and fees which are generally embedded in the price of the investment. The tax treatment of a structured investment may be complex and may differ 
from a direct investment in the underlying asset. UBS and its employees do not provide tax advice. Investors should consult their own tax advisor about their own tax situation 
before investing in any securities.

Important Information About Sustainable Investing Strategies: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and incorporate environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) factors into investment process and portfolio construction. Strategies across geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. 
Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio manager’s ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise 
would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing 
considerations may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered by the portfolio manager, and the 
investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ.

Within the past 12 months UBS Switzerland AG, its affiliates or subsidiaries may have received or provided investment services and activities or ancillary services as per MiFID 
II which may have given rise to a payment or promise of a payment in relation to these services from or to this company.
