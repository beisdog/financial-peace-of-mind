Amundi S&P 500 UCITS ETF
21 May 2025, 10:19 UTC, written by Jon Andrea Barblan

Our Chief Investment Office (CIO) believes that stock markets can gain in the near term from falling rates and
positive global growth. Within equities our CIO sees the US as one of the preferred markets.

One of our solutions to invest passively in US Equities is the Amundi S&P 500 UCITS ETF. This solution offers the following
characteristics:

• The ETF aims to track the S&P 500 Net Total Return Index.

• The Index is a widely regarded benchmark of US large caps, tracking 500 leading companies and covering
approximately 80% of the US free-float market capitalisation.

• UCITS-compliant exchange-traded fund.

Risks: The fund invests in equities and is thus riskier than cash or bonds. The Fund's performance may not exactly track
the Index. This can result from market fluctuations, changes in the composition of the Index, transaction costs, the costs
of making changes to the Fund's portfolio and other Fund expenses. Additional information about these and other risks
can be found in the Key Information Document (KID) as well as in the prospectus of the fund. Past performance is no
indication of future results.

The above information is for marketing purposes and should not be considered as personal investment advice.
