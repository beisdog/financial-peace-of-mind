World Gold Council data affirms our views

• In April 2025, gold prices have experienced significant fluctuations,
reaching an all-time high of USD 3,500/oz in mid-April before
declining to around USD 3,300/oz by month’s end—a 5% pullback
from the peak.

• World Gold Council’s first-quarter demand trends report signals
ongoing strong investment and central bank buying, with overall
demand reaching 1,206 metric tons, its strongest first quarter since
2016.

• Accordingly, we see gold well supported by “safe-haven” and
diversification demand, and like to use the elevated volatility to sell
price downside in XAUUSD at a strike of USD 3,150/oz or below.
Meanwhile, we remain long in our global asset allocation.

Gold has experienced significant price fluctuations, reaching an all-time
high of USD 3,500/oz in mid-April before declining to around USD 3,300/
oz by month’s end—a 5% pullback from the peak. The elevated volatility
has been caused by several backtracks by the Trump administration ranging
from the President’s claim he doesn’t want to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell
to less aggressive posturing between he and China. The much-anticipated
World Gold Council (WGC) first-quarter demand trends report signals
ongoing strong investment interest and central bank buying, with overall
demand reaching 1,206 metric tons (its strongest first quarter since 2016).
Investment demand was the primary driver, underpinned by a breakdown
in traditional stock-bond correlations, inflation fears, and extreme US policy
uncertainty. ETF buying surged, reversing prior outflows and boosting total
inflows to a three-year high. With buying at 226 metric tons for the
quarter, it affirms our decision to upgrade our full-year estimate to 450
metric tons mid-month (from 300 metric tons). This is the strongest annual
demand since 2020, with US-listed funds driving inflows alongside material
contributions from Europe and Asia.

Importantly, central bank buying also remained strong at 244 metric tons,
which was close to our 1Q target and upholds our full-year forecast of
around 1,000 metric tons for 2025. Again, unreported buying remains a
key factor, with IMF report volumes only capturing a part of the picture. Bar
and coin buying was also up 3% y/y, with China contributing 124 metric
tons—the second-highest on record—to a total of 325 metric tons. Jewelry
demand, as expected, was pressured by the velocity and magnitude of
the recent rally. Both China and India contributed to the weakness. Supply
did rise marginally (+1%) due to record mine output, though recycling
declined unexpectedly. So, overall, we believe first-quarter demand not
only confirms that gold is again favored in times of global dislocation,
but also increasingly we observe more longer-term investors emerging as
dedollarization trends grow. In this context, our analysis suggests that a
5% allocation to gold within a USD diversified portfolio is optimal.

expressed herein may differ or be contrary to those expressed by other business areas or divisions of UBS as a result of using
different assumptions and/or criteria.
In no circumstances may this document or any of the information (including any forecast, value, index or other calculated

to such issuers. At any time, investment decisions (including whether to buy, sell or hold securities) made by UBS and its
employees may differ from or be contrary to the opinions expressed in UBS research publications. Some investments may not
be readily realizable since the market in the securities is illiquid and therefore valuing the investment and identifying the risk
to which you are exposed may be difficult to quantify. UBS relies on information barriers to control the flow of information
contained in one or more areas within UBS, into other areas, units, divisions or affiliates of UBS. Futures and options trading
is not suitable for every investor as there is a substantial risk of loss, and losses in excess of an initial investment may occur.

less than you invested or may be required to pay more. Changes in foreign exchange rates may have an adverse effect on
the price, value or income of an investment. The analyst(s) responsible for the preparation of this report may interact with
trading desk personnel, sales personnel and other constituencies for the purpose of gathering, synthesizing and interpreting
market information.

Management. UBS Global Research is produced by UBS Investment Bank. Research methodologies and rating systems
of each separate research organization may differ, for example, in terms of investment recommendations, investment
horizon, model assumptions, and valuation methods. As a consequence, except for certain economic forecasts (for which
