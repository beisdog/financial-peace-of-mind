POTUS 47   |   The first 100 days   |   2

US presidents are always in a race against the clock to advance their policies. The wide-reach-
ing and consequential policy actions taken during President Trump’s first 100 days in office un-
derscore an even greater sense of urgency. His reelection as the oldest president to be inaugu-
rated—and only the second to be elected to a nonconsecutive term—presented him with a 
rare second chance to deliver on a mandate that may have seemed impossibly out of reach af-
ter losing the 2020 presidential election and surviving an assassination attempt during the 
2024 election campaign. Concerns that the 2026 midterm elections could threaten the current 
narrow Republican majorities in Congress may be yet another factor driving the rapid rollout of 
his policy agenda.

President Trump has signed more than 140 executive orders in his first 100 days in office—
more than any recent president—with an aim to reform the government bureaucracy, reshape 
global trading relationships and foreign policy, reverse many of the actions of the prior admin-
istration, and restore power to the executive branch. Congressional Republicans have shown 
little interest in checking the president’s ambitious agenda as they rapidly advance his signa-
ture legislation to extend the 2017 tax cuts. The courts have acted selectively to slow or halt 
some of the orders. More legal challenges are in the queue but face an uncertain outcome. 

President Trump returned to the Oval Office with the US economy operating at full employ-
ment and US stock indexes charting new record highs, partly on hopes of tax relief and dereg-
ulation. Instead, the uncertainty caused by the Trump administration’s chaotic tariff announce-
ments, government spending cuts, and immigration moves have dented his own job approval 
ratings, worsened the near-term economic outlook, raised business uncertainty, lifted inflation 
forecasts, and caused upheaval in stock, bond, and currency markets.

In this edition of POTUS 47, “The first 100 days,” we offer our perspective on a range of policy 
developments and advice for how to manage the elevated volatility that will likely persist 
throughout much of this administration. We also present ideas to harness structural and tacti-
cal opportunities that exist today because of the rise in volatility.

POTUS 47   |   The first 100 days   |   3

According to a survey of polls by Real Clear Politics, President Trump’s approval rating has 
fallen to 45% from 52% in mid January and is headed toward the average of his first term. 
Trump assumed office with the second-lowest approval rating among recent presidents, ex-
ceeding only the 2017 low at the start of his first term. Presidential job approval usually fades 
after an initial wave of post-election enthusiasm, but voter opinions have soured faster than 
usual during the first 100 days of Trump’s second term. Likewise, a majority of Americans now 
disapprove of the president’s handling of the job, up from 40% on Inauguration Day. Ameri-
cans also assign him mixed grades on a range of issues that voters say factored into their deci-
sion and his election win. The same survey of polls shows that support for his strict immigra-
tion stance has weakened, and most Americans disapprove of his handling of the economy 
(55%) and inflation (59%).

Unsurprisingly, opinions about President Trump’s job performance differ widely depending on 
the respondents’ political party affiliation. According to a Pew Research Center report, Demo-
crats express far more disapproval of Trump’s job performance (93%) and actions on a range 
of issues than Republicans approve (75%).

President Trump has governed primarily through executive order during his first 100 days in of-
fice, having signed more executive orders than any recent president, while signing the fewest 
bills into law (5) at this point in the presidency. The executive orders signed thus far cover a 
wide range of policy areas, from immigration to education to energy production to trade. The 
advantage of executive orders is their speed and force when directing agencies of the federal 
government to carry out existing statutes. That said, further court challenges could render cer-
tain executive orders illegal if they were found to be either contrary to, or overly broad inter-
pretations of, existing statutes. To become policy, Congress would have to enact legislation.

Narrow majorities in both the House and Senate, as well as an intense Republican effort to 
pass a reconciliation bill before the 4 July recess that lifts the debt limit, extends many of the 
expiring individual income tax provisions in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and raises spend-
ing on defense and border security priorities, may also explain why fewer new laws have been 
passed compared to during previous new administrations.

Few legislative wins but the most executive orders during first 100 days of

The effective tariff rate measures the average tariff rate applied across all goods (customs du-
ties divided by imports). The tariffs announced this year have lifted the effective tariff rate to 
roughly 25% based on 2024 import volumes from just 2.5%. This tariff rate is higher than the 
1930s Smoot-Hawley tariffs, yet the average conceals wide geographic variability. North Amer-
ican trading partners escaped the worst outcomes, whereas China’s tariff rate at over 100% is 
so high that it makes trade virtually uneconomical. In our view, the effective tariff rate will 
likely settle closer to 15% by year-end, but this is predicated on a substantial rollback in the 
tariffs on China—an outcome which is hard to forecast given the nature of the conflict.

The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that the economic damage caused 
by these higher effective tariff rates reduces the potential revenue that would otherwise have 
been available at lower tariff levels. The highest tariffs in more than a century—and their un-
predictability—risk choking off imports and economic activity, which limits the potential reve-
nue that could be used to offset the cost and deficit impact of extending the 2017 tax cuts. 
Higher tariffs amid a declining US dollar also put upward pressure on inflation, further raising 
the long-term cost of financing debt.

Effective tariff rate

Roughly 15% of the executive orders announced so far during President Trump’s second term 
are tied to tariffs, an area where presidents have historically been granted broad authority from 
Congress. However, President Trump has made heavy use of the International Economic Emer-
gency Powers Act (IEEPA)—a statute that has not previously been used to levy tariffs and is cur-
rently facing a growing docket of lawsuits—to justify the tariffs. Even if the courts were to 
block or enjoin the IEEPA tariffs, the administration could revive them using other statutes, such 
as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 or Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. 

Trade policy uncertainty will likely remain elevated even as it fades from these extremes. Once 
the first trade deal is announced, it could set a benchmark that helps guide expectations for 
other deals. We should expect the administration to reach agreements to lower certain tariffs 
and businesses to adapt to a new, higher level of tariffs. However, the administration will also 
announce the results of Section 232 investigations into pharmaceutical and semiconductor 
trade before year-end and may raise the rhetoric if exporting nations prove inflexible on impor-
tant trade policy goals.

POTUS 47   |   The first 100 days   |   5

Despite the widespread media coverage of government layoffs and spending cuts, federal 
spending has actually climbed at a slightly faster pace during the first four months of 2025 
than it did in 2024. One of the largest components of federal spending—interest payments on 
Treasury securities—is running at an annualized USD 60 billion higher than this time in 2024. 
This growth is poised to continue because of the rising debt stock and because newly issued 
Treasury notes and bonds command a higher interest rate than most of the maturing debt se-
curities they replace.

Whether spending actually declines in future years will depend on the result of ongoing legal 
battles over how the executive branch executes budgets passed by Congress, as well as the 
reconciliation bill coursing its way through Congress, where cuts are focused on social pro-
grams and certain provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act. The bill also proposes billions in 
new spending for border security and defense, as well as more limited revenue generation if 
lower tax rates are extended or even reduced further. Federal deficits as a share of GDP were 
double 2015 levels at the start of Trump’s second term and will likely rise further without other 
revenue offsets like tariff revenue.

The number of encounters along the southern border has fallen sharply since President Trump 
took office in January. Declaring a national emergency along the southern border to justify im-
posing 25% tariffs on Mexico through IEEPA likely prompted Mexican officials to toughen bor-
der security as part of efforts to negotiate exemptions. As a result of these and other actions, 
we anticipate much lower levels of undocumented immigration. Moreover, President Trump 
has a desire to boost the pace of deportations, and it seems likely that legal immigration will 
slow. Since there is a lag between immigrants entering the country and starting to work, we 
expect the lack of immigrant labor supply will restrain overall job growth beginning in the sec-
ond half of 2025.

The level of border security funding in the reconciliation package will likely influence the 
amount of deportations over the balance of President Trump’s term. Whether a fall in net mi-
gration creates worker shortages in certain economic sectors will depend in part on the de-
mand for labor in a slowing economy. It will likely be difficult to find replacements for workers 
who are deported. Tariffs are already poised to place upward pressure on inflation; labor 
shortages would be a further complicating factor.

The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index measures Americans’ perceptions of 
the economy and their own personal financial situation. Since 2006, the survey reports senti-
ment by political affiliation. Republican and Democratic sentiment often follows US political 
outcomes, with Americans feeling more confident when their party is in power than when the 
opposing party is in control and shifting sharply when the White House flips from one 
party to the other.

Sentiment shifts since the 2024 election have taken a remarkably similar path. Democrats have 
become much more pessimistic on both growth and inflation under Trump 2.0 and more so 
than ever before, whereas Republicans are more optimistic than they were under President 
Biden despite the overall decline in consumer sentiment to levels last seen during the 2022 
inflation surge and the 2008 global financial crisis.

Pessimism abounds in other surveys as well. According to the American Association of Individ-
ual Investors, only 21.9% of investors believe the S&P 500 will rise in the next six months. His-
torically, this level of extreme pessimism has been a contrarian indicator. After past readings of 
this magnitude, the S&P 500 delivered a positive one-year return 90% of the time, with an 
average gain of 19.7%, since this weekly survey began in 1987.

Tariffs are stagflationary, and policy uncertainty weighs on economic activity. According to sur-
veyed economists, Bloomberg’s median forecast for US GDP growth in 2025 has fallen from 
2.1% at the start of the year to 1.4% as of late April. Consumer prices are now projected to 
rise by 3.2% in 2025, up from an expected 2.5% increase at the start of the year. We believe 
tariffs and broader policy uncertainty are likely to have a relatively larger impact on the US 
economy than on most other large global economies. We now expect US economic growth of 
1.5% in 2025 versus the more than 2.0% growth we expected earlier this year. We expect 
growth of 0.7% for the Eurozone in 2025 (around 0.2 ppt weaker than when we entered the 
year) and below 4% for China (roughly 0.5 ppt weaker).

We believe the Fed will cut interest rates by 75-100 basis points beginning in September when 
the labor market is likely to show weakness. But in the near term, the Fed’s policy flexibility ap-
pears to be more limited, as it has to balance growth concerns against the risk of a resurgence 
in inflation. This tension in its policy mandate provoked the president to threaten once again to 
remove Chair Jerome Powell, only to walk it back amid the ensuing financial market volatility.

We believe the Trump administration changing its tariff stance in response to equity and bond 
market turbulence indicates some sensitivity to market stress, which points to the existence of 
a “Trump put” in some form. With many countries expressing a desire to negotiate with the 
US on tariff policy, and the Trump administration now somewhat pressured to demonstrate 
“success,” we expect a variety of deals or sector carveouts to materialize within the 90-day 
pause period, which could also be extended if needed to provide more time for negotiations. 
Since Inauguration Day, US stocks have underperformed non-US developed stocks—an un-
usual development over the past decade—amid increased policy uncertainty and tariffs, high-
lighting the value of geographic diversification amid this recent episode of elevated volatility. 

The S&P 500 has also performed well historically after periods of elevated market volatility. 
While each case is different, based on data going back to 1990, levels of the VIX above 40 
(the index reached a high of 60 in early April) have been followed on average by one-year re-
turns of more than 30% on the S&P 500. We expect the S&P 500 to rise to 5,800 by the end 
of 2025 as tariff uncertainty eases, the Fed likely cuts interest rates, and investors’ focus shifts 
toward the prospect of a rebound in US earnings growth in 2026. We believe that phasing-in 
or capital preservation approaches can allow investors to benefit from medium-term growth 
while managing near-term timing risks.

Equities

The relationship between the US dollar and 10-year Treasury yields suddenly broke down 
when President Trump announced universal and reciprocal tariffs in early April. The yield on 
10-year and 30-year Treasuries rose sharply and the US dollar weakened, stoking concern that 
foreign investors were shunning US assets. With bond yields relatively high, the yield curve 
steeper, and economic growth likely to slow, we see an opportunity for investors to switch 
cash into high-quality bonds and diversified fixed income portfolios to lock in yields, dampen 
overall portfolio volatility, and provide additional robust income. In our base case, we see the 
10-year Treasury yield at 4.0% by year-end and believe it could fall to 2.5% in a hard 
landing scenario.

After its notable recent selloff, the US dollar may stabilize in the near term, in our view, espe-
cially with the Fed sounding caution on rate cuts at the same time as other central banks are 
cutting rates in response to the deteriorating growth outlook. Gold has been the standout 
performer year to date. While our year-end forecast stands at USD 3,500/oz, further US politi-
cal uncertainty could lead to greater demand for perceived “safe havens” and support a move 
to our upside risk case of USD 3,800/oz.

POTUS 47   |   The first 100 days   |   8

The first 100 days of Donald Trump’s second term have been marked by heightened political 
uncertainty, shifting trade policies, and unsettling market responses. We advise investors to 
consider strategies that can help portfolios navigate future political risks while taking advan-
tage of volatility.

Manage volatility. For investors concerned about the near-term risks and looking to hedge 
portfolios against potential further downside.

• Navigate political risks: Gold remains near record highs, reaffirming its value as a hedge 
amid ongoing geopolitical and political risks. With our price target raised to USD 3,500/oz 
through early 2026, we see gold well supported by “safe haven” demand and structural 
buying. We favor using dips as buying opportunities or entering defensively to protect gains. 
For investors seeking to preserve gains while retaining upside, capital preservation strategies 
can also be applied in equities. Silver, meanwhile, offers a complementary play, with invest-
ment demand expected to support prices alongside gold.

Conclusion

• Seek durable income: Despite the significant increase in downside risks to growth, bond 
yields have remained elevated. We believe this creates an opportunity for investors to seek 
durable portfolio income. High grade and investment grade bonds offer attractive risk-re-
ward and can help hedge against market downturns. Much wider credit spreads are improv-
ing the outlook for riskier credit; however, with economic visibility low, we prefer diversified 
portfolio income strategies—including senior loans, private credit, equity income, and higher 
quality credit.

Look through volatility. For investors who were underinvested going into the sell-off and/or 
are willing to take on near-term risk for likely long-term reward.

• Phase into equities: While we expect near-term volatility to remain high, we anticipate eq-
uities will rise by year-end as the Trump administration strikes deals to reduce tariffs, and as 
likely rate cuts and potential fiscal support improve investor sentiment. Investors can navi-
gate near-term volatility and position for longer-term upside by phasing into US equities or 
balanced portfolios, or by utilizing capital preservation strategies.

Take advantage of volatility. For investors unsure about the near term but looking to utilize 
high levels of volatility to earn additional portfolio income.

• Seek sell-off opportunities: Recent volatility has created select attractive opportunities at 
the single stock and market level. Various companies with strong long-term prospects are 
now trading at more attractive valuations. In the US, we have identified 20 companies across 
sectors that are higher quality, have solid business models, and offer good long-term value. 
In Europe, our “Six ways to invest in Europe” list focuses on defensive champions benefiting 
from market volatility, higher defense spending, and fiscal stimulus. In Asia, we favor 
India and Taiwan.

Transformational Innovation Opportunities (TRIOs). We continue to see strong long-term 
potential in our TRIOs: Artificial intelligence, Longevity, and Power and resources. While com-
panies exposed to each of these ideas have been caught up in near-term derisking, we expect 
structural trends to be the biggest drivers over the long term, and the recent sell-off provides a 
potential opportunity for investors to build structural exposure.

or have officers, who serve as directors, either to/for the issuer, the investment instrument itself or to/for any 
company commercially or financially affiliated to such issuers. At any time, investment decisions (including 
whether to buy, sell or hold securities) made by UBS and its employees may differ from or be contrary to the 
opinions expressed in UBS research publications. Some investments may not be readily realizable since the 
market in the securities is illiquid and therefore valuing the investment and identifying the risk to which you 
are exposed may be difficult to quantify. UBS relies on information barriers to control the flow of information 
contained in one or more areas within UBS, into other areas, units, divisions or affiliates of UBS. Futures and 

options trading is not suitable for every investor as there is a substantial risk of loss, and losses in excess of 
an initial investment may occur. Past performance of an investment is no guarantee for its future perfor-
mance. Additional information will be made available upon request. Some investments may be subject to 
sudden and large falls in value and on realization you may receive back less than you invested or may be 
required to pay more. Changes in foreign exchange rates may have an adverse effect on the price, value or 
income of an investment. The analyst(s) responsible for the preparation of this report may interact with trad-
ing desk personnel, sales personnel and other constituencies for the purpose of gathering, synthesizing and 
interpreting market information.

Different areas, groups, and personnel within UBS Group may produce and distribute separate research 
products independently of each other. For example, research publications from CIO are produced by UBS 
Global Wealth Management. UBS Global Research is produced by UBS Investment Bank. Research meth-
odologies and rating systems of each separate research organization may differ, for example, in 
terms of investment recommendations, investment horizon, model assumptions, and valuation methods. As 
a consequence, except for certain economic forecasts (for which UBS CIO and UBS Global Research may 
collaborate), investment recommendations, ratings, price targets, and valuations provided by each of the 
separate research organizations may be different, or inconsistent. You should refer to each relevant research 
product for the details as to their methodologies and rating system. Not all clients may have access to all 
products from every organization. Each research product is subject to the policies and procedures of the 
organization that produces it. 
The compensation of the analyst(s) who prepared this report is determined exclusively by research manage-
ment and senior management (not including investment banking). Analyst compensation is not based on 
investment banking, sales and trading or principal trading revenues, however, compensation may relate to 
the revenues of UBS Group as a whole, of which investment banking, sales and trading and principal trading 
are a part.

Tax treatment depends on the individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future. UBS does 
not provide legal or tax advice and makes no representations as to the tax treatment of assets or the invest-
ment returns thereon both in general or with reference to specific client’s circumstances and needs. We are 
of necessity unable to take into account the particular investment objectives, financial situation and needs of 
our individual clients and we would recommend that you take financial and/or tax advice as to the implica-
tions (including tax) of investing in any of the products mentioned herein.

Important Information About Sustainable Investing Strategies: Sustainable investing strategies aim to 
consider and incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into investment process and 
portfolio construction. Strategies across geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in 
a variety of ways. Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit UBS’s ability 
to participate in or to advise on certain investment opportunities that otherwise would be consistent with the 
Client’s investment objectives. The returns on a portfolio incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing 
considerations may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability 
issues are not considered by UBS, and the investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ.

External Asset Managers / External Financial Consultants: In case this research or publication is pro-
vided to an External Asset Manager or an External Financial Consultant, UBS expressly prohibits that it is 
redistributed by the External Asset Manager or the External Financial Consultant and is made available to
