USDCAD: Canada’s Liberals win minority
government
CIO View: USDCAD

Patrick Ernst, CFA, FX Strategist, UBS Switzerland AG
Constantin Bolz, CFA, Strategist, UBS Switzerland AG

• Since the "Liberation Day" announcements, USDCAD has had a wild
ride and now sits close to where it was just before the US elections.

• While the US administration’s initial tariff threats mainly targeted
Canada and Mexico, its focus has shifted to other trading partners.
We do not think that Canada is off the hook but acknowledge the
latest relief.

• The newly elected PM Carney is likely to accelerate trade negotiations
with the US and give the CAD more stability.

Canada’s Liberals win minority government
Former central bank governor Mark Carney won the Canadian elections,
though with a minority government as his Liberal party is projected to have
only 169 seats, just short of the 172-seat majority. However, we expect PM
Carney to be able to get other parties on board to decide on his announced
fiscal measures. With Carney now backed by an electoral mandate, we
think trade negotiations can accelerate further. His announced increased
domestic fiscal spending, if enacted, would help dampen recession risks,
while also offering the Bank of Canada some headroom on policy as it
weighs both growth and inflation risks.

Tariff risks remain the main driver
While Canada appears to be faring better than initially expected, we
caution against the view that tariff risks will not have a significant impact
on the Canadian economy. After all, substantial levies have already been
imposed on certain industries, and additional sector-specific tariffs—such
as those on lumber—are still looming. Hence, any tariff news will remain
key for the USDCAD, and we think it’s too early to call off any respective
downside risks. Furthermore, the Canadian economy is not in a good place:
Elevated Bank of Canada policy rates for an extended period have taken
their toll, and productivity growth has been lagging that of peers for some
time. On the bright side, the recently lowered policy rates should make
their way through the system quickly and lend some support.

Investment considerations
Prospects: The USDCAD has gotten some respite recently with trade
tensions shifting away from Canada. We believe the pair will progressively
fall over our forecast horizon.
Boundaries: The earlier 1.46 high remains the major resistance level,
which we do not expect to break sustainably. Support sits around 1.35.
Risk factors: A tariff escalation with the US is a major downside risk to
the CAD. A deterioration in the US economy and an erosion of trust in the
USD as a relative safe haven could weaken the USD.

Generic investment research – Risk information:
This publication is for your information only and is not intended as an offer, or a solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell
any investment or other specific product. The analysis contained herein does not constitute a personal recommendation or
take into account the particular investment objectives, investment strategies, financial situation and needs of any specific
recipient. It is based on numerous assumptions. Different assumptions could result in materially different results. Certain

not be eligible for sale to all investors. All information and opinions expressed in this document were obtained from sources
believed to be reliable and in good faith, but no representation or warranty, express or implied, is made as to its accuracy
or completeness (other than disclosures relating to UBS). All information and opinions as well as any forecasts, estimates
and market prices indicated are current as of the date of this report, and are subject to change without notice. Opinions
expressed herein may differ or be contrary to those expressed by other business areas or divisions of UBS as a result of using
different assumptions and/or criteria.
In no circumstances may this document or any of the information (including any forecast, value, index or other calculated
amount ("Values")) be used for any of the following purposes (i) valuation or accounting purposes; (ii) to determine the
amounts due or payable, the price or the value of any financial instrument or financial contract; or (iii) to measure the
performance of any financial instrument including, without limitation, for the purpose of tracking the return or performance

to such issuers. At any time, investment decisions (including whether to buy, sell or hold securities) made by UBS and its
employees may differ from or be contrary to the opinions expressed in UBS research publications. Some investments may not
be readily realizable since the market in the securities is illiquid and therefore valuing the investment and identifying the risk
to which you are exposed may be difficult to quantify. UBS relies on information barriers to control the flow of information
contained in one or more areas within UBS, into other areas, units, divisions or affiliates of UBS. Futures and options trading
is not suitable for every investor as there is a substantial risk of loss, and losses in excess of an initial investment may occur.

less than you invested or may be required to pay more. Changes in foreign exchange rates may have an adverse effect on
the price, value or income of an investment. The analyst(s) responsible for the preparation of this report may interact with
trading desk personnel, sales personnel and other constituencies for the purpose of gathering, synthesizing and interpreting
market information.

Management. UBS Global Research is produced by UBS Investment Bank. Research methodologies and rating systems
of each separate research organization may differ, for example, in terms of investment recommendations, investment
horizon, model assumptions, and valuation methods. As a consequence, except for certain economic forecasts (for which

provided by each of the separate research organizations may be different, or inconsistent. You should refer to each relevant
