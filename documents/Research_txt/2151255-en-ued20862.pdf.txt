Resilience Underappreciated, China Concerns 
Overstated; Upgrade to Buy

Bottom Line 
We're upgrading Revvity (RVTY) to Buy from Neutral with a view that its growth 
algorithm could be upside differentiated vs peers'. Self help in its reagents business 
(~25% of sales), growth in autoimmune testing (~15%), and lesser exposure to 
demand pressures in U.S. aca/gov (5%) should enable upside differentiation.  
Further, we think investor concerns on China diagnostics (~9%) are overblown. 

Revvity's growth differential is already evident: Q1 org sales grew 4% vs peers at 1.5%. 
Further, Revvity maintained its ~4% 2025 growth guidance, while peers have so far cut 
by 100bps. We believe a sustained performance gap will become better appreciated and 
help drive a re-rating for the stock.  

Self help, differential exposure shield life sciences from the worst of industry 
challenges
Following a recent NDR, we gained a better understanding of Revvity's self-help growth 
drivers in reagents, namely 1) e-commerce, 2) new products, and 3) GMP proteins. 
Separately, Revvity  has lesser exposure to acute demand pressures in U.S. aca/gov 
markets vs ~8% peer median. Finally, while 2025 software strength (+high-teens vs 9-
11% LRP) creates a challenging 2026 comp, a recent peer takeout for 39x '25 EBITDA 
offers a constructive market assessment, underwriting ~15% industry growth.  

Autoimmune checks out; growth has runway, China Dx concerns overblown  
 Takeaways from recent doc diligence on autoimmune diagnostics suggest both 
strong growth prospects and a greater competitive moat than we appreciated. Forecasts 
for strong market growth  (+10% - 15% annually) and high switching costs between 
platforms were highlights. Separately, while investors remain concerned by Revvity's 
~9% exposure to China diagnostics, the takeaways from our recent China field trip 
suggest these concerns are overblown; Revvity's +HSD growth in China diagnostics 
-- vs (DD) peer declines -- support this view.       

Valuation and estimates
We're lowering our PT from $145 to $115 due to peer multiple compression. Our new 
PT is based on 16x TTM Mar'27e EBITDA (vs.20x prior).  ~16x  is ~3% / ~0.5x premium to 
the group multiple (vs. in line prior), reflecting our expectation that Revvity could deliver 
higher growth vs. peers in a challenging macro backdrop. Our estimates are little 
changed following Revvity's Q1 results.

Thesis Map            UBS                        Research         THESIS MAP       a guide to our thinking and what´s where in this report  

Q:  Can immunodiagnostics grow above market even with its China exposure? 
Yes. We expect Revvity's immunodiagnostics business to grow above market  (5yr-CAGR of +8% vs 
+6% market) with potential upside from new products. Revvity's ~9% sales exposure to China 
diagnostics  attracts a heightened level of investor attention. Despite increasing local competition, we 
believe risk skews to the upside as Revvity benefits from increasing market penetration with its 
breadth of menu and the risk of incremental policy-driven pricing headwind is low in the near term. 
Outside of China, we see additional growth drivers from continued U.S. market expansion (15% of 
immunoDx sales vs. +38% peers), growth in autoimmune testing (+15%) and continued market 
penetration. We also see potential upsides from new test products (e.g. latent tuberculosis testing). 

Q: Will Revvity's portfolio mix insulate the company from macro challenges?
Yes, we believe Revvity is well positioned to achieve differentiated growth vs. peers in a challenging 
time, driven by its diversified portfolio (~50% of sales from diagnostics), limited U.S. academic 
research exposure (~5% of total sales), and higher growth in Software. Further,  we believe the 
growth drivers for its reagents business (~25% of total sales) are underappreciated. We continue to 
expect relatively healthy growth vs. peers driven by its oversized exposure to pharma/biotech vs. 
academic research, new product introductions, and uplift in e-commerce and GMP reagent 
expansion. Revvity's growth differential is already evident: Q1 org sales grew 4% vs peers at 1.5%. 
Further, Revvity maintained its ~4% 2025 growth guidance, while peers have so far cut by 100bps.

Our Buy rating on Revvity (RVTY) reflects a view a view that Revvity is well positioned to drive 
differentiated growth vs. peers. Self help in its reagents business (~25% of sales), growth in 
autoimmune testing (~15%), and lesser exposure to demand pressures in U.S. aca/gov (5%) should 
enable upside differentiation.  Further, we think investor concerns on China diagnostics (~9%) are 
overblown. Overall, we don't believe the current price level reflects the above-peer growth we 
expect. 

Our forecasts consider Revvity's historical performance, industry benchmarks, market analysis in Life 
Science and Diagnostics, conversations with management and industry experts, as well as our recent 
China field trip. 

Revvity currently trades 15x forward 12 month TTM EBITDA multiple (vs. 15.5x peer median), which 
implies lesser than peer growth vs the peer premium we believe is attainable. Revvity's growth 
differential is already evident: Q1 organic sales grew 4% vs peers at 1.5%. Further, Revvity 
maintained its ~4% 2025 growth guidance, while peers have so far cut by 100bps. Tools companies 
with higher growth typically get a valuation premium historically, especially during periods with a 
tougher backdrop.

    UBS             VIEW   

Yes. We expect Revvity's immunodiagnostics business to grow above market  (5yr-
CAGR of +8% vs +6% market) with potential upside from new products. Revvity's 
~9% sales exposure to China diagnostics  attracts a heightened level of investor

from new test products (e.g. latent tuberculosis testing). 

Evidence

Our China field trip, expert calls,  a deep-dive analysis in the global/China 
autoimmune markets, competitive landscape and recent regulatory changes in 
China diagnostics supports our view. We've also analyzed historical performance of 
Revvity's immunodiagostics business to understand the key growth drivers across 
regions.  

WHAT´S PRICED IN?

Revvity currently trades 15x forward 12 month TTM EBITDA multiple (vs. 15.5x peer 
median), which implies lesser than peer growth vs the peer premium we believe is 
attainable. The lower organic sales suggests the market underappreciates the 
immunodiagnostics opportunity and/or overstates the China diagnostics concern. 

China Diagnostics: Risk Skews to the Upside

Revvity's ~9% sales exposure to the China diagnostics market has received a heightened 
level of investor attention around local competition and policy-driven pricing 
headwinds. Following our field trip in China, we believe risk skews to the upside for 
Revvity and its mid-single-digit%  China diagnostics growth (+5% UBSe) compares 
favorably vs. peers in 2025. 

Low penetration of autoimmune testing supports higher volume  growth vs. 
routine testing 

There are ~80M people with autoimmune disease in China with high prevalence in 
autoimmune thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis and Graves' disease (Figure 1Autoimmune disease prevalence in China ). However, 
autoimmune disease is underdiagnosed and undertreated in the country. In China, there 
are only ~8,300 rheumatologists/immunologists in  ~2,800 hospitals (out of 38K 
hospitals) (Figure 2Number of rheumatologists/immunologists doubled in 6 years; expect ~12% CAGR growth till 2040). In 2019, the government issued guidance that required Class 3 
hospitals and encouraged Class 2 hospitals to setup independent rheumatology/
immunology department and clinical labs to support diagnosis. We estimate that 
currently ~930 hospitals have independent rheumatology/immunology department, 
which is ~7% of total Class 2 and 3 hospitals. As the awareness of autoimmune disease 
and number of rheumatologists/immunologists continue to increase (Figure 2Number of rheumatologists/immunologists doubled in 6 years; expect ~12% CAGR growth till 2040), we 
estimate autoimmune testing to have low-teens% volume growth vs. +MSD% for 
routine testing in China.

Risk of incremental policy-driven pricing headwind is low in the near term

The alliance volume-based procurement programs (VBPs) in 2023-2024 have covered 
~70% of the chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) tests in China (Figure 3China immunodiagnostics business mix by test type). Our 
channel checks from the China field trip and expert call suggest that autoimmune / 
allergy are unlikely to be the priority for next round of VBP in 2025 or reimbursement 
change as the testing volume remains small vs. routine testing. Further, a large portion of 
EUROIMMUN's autoimmune/allergy portfolio uses different technologies that are not 
subject to the VBPs, e.g, enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA), indirect 
immunofluorescence (IIFT),  and immunoblot, which tend  to have ~2x lower 
reimbursement rate vs. CLIA tests. Therefore, we believe the risk of incremental pricing 
headwind from VBP/reimbursement is low in the near term.

Ability to maintain significant share despite increasing competition

Western players have been losing shares in the recent years  - Revvity's autoimmune 
market share has declined from ~64% in 2018 to ~40% in 2024, while its competitors 
(mainly YHLO and HOB)'s market shares have increased from  ~13% to ~24% during the 
same period (Figure 4China autoimmune testing market share by vendors ). 

While we expect the competition to continue as more local players are entering the 
market, we believe Revvity/Euroimmun can slow share erosion and   maintain its market 
position given 

� Breadth of menu: Physicians typically order 10+ tests at the first visit to 
determine the actual cause of the disease and therefore the size of menu matters 
(Figure 5Instrument / test menu comparison for select autoimmune players in China ). While local competitors might have an advantage  on the CLIA platform, 
Euroimmun has sizable test menu across different testing platforms, which provide 
suitable solutions for different settings. Separately, Euroimmun is working with an 
OEM partner to expand its CLIA menu, which could slow its share erosion.

� Euroimmun is an early entrant to the Chinese market, which helps educate/
train the physicians in the past decades. We expect the company to benefit from 
increasing market penetration. 

That said, factoring in growth opportunity in China specialty diagnostics, increasing local 
competition and general pricing headwinds (outside of VBP/reimbursement), we expect 
Revvity's China immunodiagnostics to grow at ~5% (Figure 6Expect Revvity's China immunodiagnostics to grow at ~5% ), which is consistent with 
its 2024 growth and mgmt's outlook in 2025. We think ~5% growth compares 
favorably to its peers in the near term. For example, large diagnostics peers reported 
double-digit decline in China  Diagnostics in Q1'25 (~20% decline for Danaher, 35% 
decline for Abbott,  and double-digit% decline for Roche).

See Additional Growth Drivers Outside of China

Outside of China, we see additional growth drivers for Revvity's immunodiagnostics 
portfolio. 

Continued US market expansion

Revvity's immunodiagnostics business has been grown ~9% 5-year CAGR (Figure 7Revvity's immunodiagnostics growing faster than peers (5-yr compounded growth)), 
which is faster than its peers (Figure 8Revvity's immunodiagnostics grew above its peer groups),  with its U.S. region growing faster at ~25% 
CAGR (Figure 8Revvity's immunodiagnostics outperformance was largely driven by market expansion). The U.S. market is currently only ~15% of Revvity's 
immunodiagnostics business vs. ~38% diagnostics peer average, suggesting there is 
further room to grow. Further, our channel checks suggest continued strong growth in 
autoimmune testing given 

� Increasing prevalence in the U.S. (Figure 9Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) prevalence is increasing in the US)

� Expanding list of biomarkers and complexity of autoimmune disease drive testing 
volume growth (i.e., specific autoantibodies have multiple clinical associations, 
which requires more testing to identify the actual disease) (Figure 10Conventional biomarkers are not specific to one disease )

� More drugs are entering in the clinical trials with increasing use in prognostics and 
monitoring. One expert expected 10-15% volume growth and considered 
autoimmune disease testing the second largest diagnostics category after 
oncology. 

We believe  Revvity should benefit from greater recognition / diagnose of the disease 
biomarkers and continued market penetration given its market leading position (Figure 
11Revvity is a leading player in autoimmune testing market).

Potential upsides from new test categories

The latent tuberculosis inflection (TB) testing is a growing market with high volume 
(>75M tests globally per ann.) and relatively high barrier of entry. The traditional latent 
TB testing is tuberculin skin test (~60% of total market) (Figure 12See skin test conversion opportunity ) but it's increasingly 
shifting to Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) test given higher accuracy and fully 
automation. In addition to the skin test conversion, we see additional growth 
opportunities from the expansion into new patient groups and emerging markets, 
supported by various guidelines (Figure 13 List of select guidelines and countries that recommend or require TB screening ).  

In prior channel checks, one expert believed the lack of fully automation put Revvity's T-
SPOT at a disadvantage  vs. its main competitor, Qiagen's QuantiFERON. We believe the 
recent FDA approval of the Auto-Pure 2000 liquid handling platform could partially solve 
the issue, for all but the largest labs. And therefore, faster commercial ramp of this fully 
automated solution in the U.S. could be  potential upside to our current forecasts. The 
company also has plans in expanding into adjacent categories, including Alzheimer's 
Disease and active tuberculosis testing.

diagnostics), limited U.S. academic research exposure (~5% of total sales), and 
higher growth in Software business. Further,  we believe the growth drivers for its

expect relatively healthy growth vs. peers driven by its oversized exposure to 
pharma/biotech vs. academic research, new product introduction, uplift in uplift in 
e-commerce and GMP reagent expansion despite in a challenging time. 

Evidence

Our forecasts are based on a detailed analysis of Revvity's historical performance, 
industry benchmarks & peer analysis. Additionally, we have analyzed Revvity's 
relevant end markets, including biopharma, academic & government, and 
diagnostic customer bases

WHAT´S PRICED IN?

Revvity currently trades 15x forward 12 month TTM EBITDA multiple (vs. 15.5x peer 
median), which implies lesser than peer growth vs the peer premium we believe is 
attainable. It suggests that investors expect material headwinds in Revvity's Life 
Science portfolio given the challenging macro.

 Relatively resilient portfolio in a challenging environment 

The ongoing National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding concerns  and tariff  add further 
pressures to an already challenging demand environment. While Revvity is not  immune 
from these macro headwinds, we believe the company is in a better position given its 
differentiated portfolio

� ~50% of Revvity's total revenue is from diagnostics, which is less impacted by 
challenging biopharma demand and ongoing academic funding uncertainty.  

� The upper-teens% growth outlook for the Signals business (8% of total revenue)  
in 2025 could partially offset the weakness in other end markets. 

� Revvity has a relatively small exposure to the U.S. academic research market  (Figure 
14Aca / Gov't Exposure Comparison) of ~5%, ~1% of which is instrument. While consumables business has been 
impacted by academic funding uncertainty, Revvity's reagent business is more 
exposed to pharma/biotech vs. academic research. 

� Mgmt. expects to fully mitigate tariff impact of $135M by supply chain 
regionalization, selective pricing increase and cost actions.

Reagent's growth drivers are underappreciated

We consider  Tools reagent business is one of most predictable and sustainable business 
models in the industry given its recurring nature, which helps drive resilient performance 
in a  challenging time. Illustrated in Figure 15Predictable and sustainable business model in the reagent business and recent NDR, Revvity's consistent new 
product cadence of 100-150 new products monthly will continue to drive revenue 
growth in the future. Further, growth opportunities are consistent across the reagent 
portfolio. The growth rate in its non-BioLegend reagent business is similar to 
BioLegend's. >50% of BioLegend's sales are transacted on e-commerce, vs. <15% for 
the non-BioLegend reagent portfolio, suggesting room for meaningful uplift of the 
latter.

Additionally, GMP reagents could be meaningful revenue growth contribution in the 
coming years. Revvity is expanding its downstream capabilities but is still early innings in 
its efforts. GMP reagents comprises <$2M of sales today with <15 GMP customers. The 
company has recently completed a GMP manufacturing facility build and is stepping up

investments in GMP salesforce.  Historically, GMP reagent business highly correlates to 
the progress of the cell and gene therapy (CGT)'s preclinical pipelines, illustrated by 
Revvity's competitor's (Bio-Techne) GMP reagent growth in Figure 16GMP reagent portfolio is closely correlated to the cell gene therapy's preclinical pipeline development , and the GMP 
reagent volume will increase  as clinical trials move to later stages and commercialization. 
While the number of CGT's preclinical pipelines has been flat to declined in 2023/24, an 
eventual return of biotech funding will support CGT preclinical development.  We also 
believe the GMP ramp could be shorter for Revvity vs. Bio-Techne, who took ~7 years to 
build the portfolio from low-single-digit million sales to ~$40M today, as the CGT 
market is more acceptive of RUO and GMP conversion  vs. 10 years ago.

Revvity Inc UBS Research

Valuation
Our $115 price target is based on 16x TTM Mar'27 EBITDA, from 20x prior due to group 
multiple compression. The ~16x EV/EBITDA multiple is ~3% / ~0.5x premium to the 
group multiple (vs. in line prior). The premium multiple reflects our expectation that 
Revvity could deliver higher growth vs. peers in a challenging macro backdrop given its 
diversified portfolio and limited U.S. academic research exposure. We expect the median 
4-year sales CAGR ('24-28e) for the peer group to trend lower post Q1 earnings season. 
Revvity's growth differential is already evident: Q1 org sales grew 4% vs peers at 1.5%. 
Further, Revvity maintained its ~4% 2025 growth guidance, while peers have so far cut 
by 100bps. We believe a sustained performance gap will become better appreciated and 
help drive a re-rating for the stock.

KEY DEFINITIONS: Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over 
the next 12 months. In some cases, this yield may be based on accrued dividends. Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as 
the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a forecast of, the equity risk premium). Under Review (UR) 
Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are subject to possible change in the 
near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. Short-Term Ratings reflect the expected 
near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months.

EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES: UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors 
such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Sell: Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. Core 
Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review Consultation (IRC). 
Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's debt. As a result, stocks 
deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rating. When such exceptions apply, 
they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.

For financial instruments admitted to trading on a non-EU regulated market: UBS may act as a market maker save that where this activity is carried out in the US in accordance

Investing in structured investments involves significant risks. For a detailed discussion of the risks involved in investing in any particular structured investment, you must read 
the relevant offering materials for that investment. Structured investments are unsecured obligations of a particular issuer with returns linked to the performance of an 
underlying asset. Depending on the terms of the investment, investors could lose all or a substantial portion of their investment based on the performance of the underlying 
asset. Investors could also lose their entire investment if the issuer becomes insolvent. UBS does not guarantee in any way the obligations or the financial condition of any 
issuer or the accuracy of any financial information provided by any issuer. Structured investments are not traditional investments and investing in a structured investment is 
not equivalent to investing directly in the underlying asset. Structured investments may have limited or no liquidity, and investors should be prepared to hold their investment 
to maturity. The return of structured investments may be limited by a maximum gain, participation rate or other feature. Structured investments may include call features and, 
if a structured investment is called early, investors would not earn any further return and may not be able to reinvest in similar investments with similar terms. Structured 
investments include costs and fees which are generally embedded in the price of the investment. The tax treatment of a structured investment may be complex and may differ 
from a direct investment in the underlying asset. UBS and its employees do not provide tax advice. Investors should consult their own tax advisor about their own tax situation 
before investing in any securities.

Important Information About Sustainable Investing Strategies: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and incorporate environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) factors into investment process and portfolio construction. Strategies across geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. 
Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio manager’s ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise 
would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing 
considerations may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered by the portfolio manager, and the 
investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ.

Within the past 12 months UBS Switzerland AG, its affiliates or subsidiaries may have received or provided investment services and activities or ancillary services as per MiFID 
II which may have given rise to a payment or promise of a payment in relation to these services from or to this company.
