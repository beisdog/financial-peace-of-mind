• On 11 April, the USDCHF fell to as low as 0.8140,
levels seen only twice since 2011, amid tariff fears,
safe-haven inflows, and a weakening US dollar.

• We think the SNB may consider rate cuts or
interventions to manage the franc's strength and
excessive volatility.

• We see the USDCHF trading in a range of
0.79-0.88 against this backdrop, while the
EURCHF may trade in a 0.91-0.96 range. We
recommend considering high-quality dividend
stocks in Switzerland that offer around 3%
returns.

What happened?
Over the past 24 hours, the USDCHF has fallen sharply to
as low as 0.814, a level seen only twice since 2011. On a
broader basis, the Swiss franc has appreciated by around
5% in trade-weighted terms in recent days amid ongoing
market turmoil and global economic growth concerns, and
as investors weigh the impact of the trade war initiated by
the US.

The franc's "safe-haven" status has been amplified by
global trade disruptions and a weakening US dollar.
Appreciation pressure also likely rose on a squeeze on
speculative short positions in the currency.

A significant portion of the franc's recent strength is
tied to the US dollar's weakness, driven by tariff-related
uncertainties and broader market volatility. The USD index
has experienced fluctuations reminiscent of the "Liz Truss
moment" in the gilt market in 2022, with the dollar
remaining lower compared to pre-tariff announcement
levels. In the near term, we believe further dollar weakness is
likely on both tariff risks and anticipation of Federal Reserve
easing.

In addition, we saw the Swiss franc appreciate against the
euro, with the EURCHF trading almost as low as 0.922

as safe-haven demand overrode any euro support from
fiscal expansion. As global investors diversify from the
USD, the EUR benefits from its liquidity, but the CHF's
strength remains evident. The upcoming European Central
Bank (ECB) meeting may result in a rate cut, potentially
tempering near-term euro strength. However, if volatility
and uncertainty fade, the EURCHF should move back toward
0.95 in the second half of this year.

What do we expect?
The Swiss National Bank (SNB) now faces increasing pressure
to address the franc's rise, with potential actions influenced
by the ECB's forthcoming decisions.

The SNB has a history of managing the franc's strength,
particularly during periods of global uncertainty. In 2011,
the SNB set a minimum exchange rate of 1.20 CHF per
euro to curb the franc's appreciation, a policy that was
abruptly abandoned in 2015, leading to significant market
volatility. We think these past interventions underscore the
SNB's readiness to take decisive action to protect the Swiss
economy from excessive currency strength, if warranted.

If market distress persists, the franc is likely to remain strong,
prompting the SNB to consider several measures to curb its
appreciation:

• Policy rate cut: The SNB may opt for a rate cut in June
if the franc's strength continues, especially if the ECB
signals further easing. A 25-basis-point reduction to
0% could be on the table, particularly if inflation moves
into negative territory. Historically, rate cuts have been
used to lower borrowing costs and weaken the franc
by making Swiss assets less attractive to yield-seeking
investors.

• Foreign exchange interventions: The SNB could
engage in foreign currency purchases to counter
temporary appreciation pressures. This approach
offers flexibility but risks being perceived as currency
manipulation, potentially escalating trade tensions with
the US. In the past, such interventions have provided
immediate relief to appreciation pressures but have also
led to diplomatic challenges.

• Emergency rate cut: In a more aggressive move,
the SNB might implement an emergency rate cut if
it deems the franc's appreciation a significant threat
to inflation and economic growth. This would be the
most radical option, potentially opening the door to
additional easing measures. Historically, emergency rate
cuts have signaled serious concerns about economic
conditions, leading to further monetary easing and
liquidity measures.

The SNB's decisions will be influenced by the ECB's policy
moves, as coordinated easing could help manage the franc's
strength. ECB actions could provide a framework for SNB
measures, aligning regional monetary policy to stabilize
currency fluctuations.

Factors such as low yield and improving European GDP
growth should eventually lead to a weaker CHF. In the
meantime, the SNB's policy decisions will be crucial in
managing the franc's near-term trajectory and mitigating
any adverse economic impacts.

We expect the Swiss economy to grow by 1% in 2025,
supported by consumer demand. However, we do not
anticipate foreign demand to contribute to GDP growth this
year, given the uncertainty surrounding the tariff dispute. If
the Swiss franc continues to appreciate, linked to recession
risks in other regions, economic growth could slow to 0.5%
or less.

What are our investment views?

EURCHF and USDCHF
Fundamentally, the Swiss franc remains in real terms below
its historical highs. In our base scenario of a reduction

in tariffs from current levels, the appreciation pressure on
the Swiss franc could gradually ease. In this scenario, the
euro should be supported by German fiscal expansion.
We continue to see the EURCHF exchange rate at 0.95
over a 12-month horizon. However, in the current risk-off
environment, downward pressure on the EURCHF could
persist. In such a scenario, we expect the SNB to lean against
a rapid fall in the pair, making a strong move below the all-
time lows unlikely.

Following the tariff announcement, fears of a US recession
have increased significantly, and markets have begun pricing
in considerably more interest rate cuts by the Fed. As a
result, the Swiss franc has appreciated substantially against
the USD. If expectations of a slowdown in the US economy
are confirmed and the Fed significantly lowers interest
rates, the US dollar is likely to depreciate further. With
the EURUSD breaking through its 2023 high, a short-term
move above 1.15 is possible. As the SNB is likely to keep
the EURCHF broadly stable, the USDCHF will depend on
EURUSD movements. If the EURUSD moves above 1.15, the
USDCHF would likely dip below 0.80. We see the USDCHF
at 0.83 in 12 months, but expect a wide range on near-term
volatility.

Swiss 10-year yields
Yields on Swiss government bonds have declined
significantly since the announcement of US tariffs,
likely reflecting lower economic growth expectations and
increased uncertainty. We see long-term yields rising slightly
once global trade tensions start to ease. Consequently,
we keep our 12-month forecast for 10-year Swiss yields
unchanged at 0.50%. In a downside scenario, where the
SNB lowers its policy rate into negative territory, the 10-
year yields would likely fall to 0%. Conversely, in a positive
scenario characterized by a rapid easing of global trade
tensions, the 10-year yields could rise to their recent highs
of between 0.70% and 0.80%.

Swiss high-quality dividend stocks
Investing in Swiss high-quality dividend stocks can be
appealing as interest rates decline, providing a defensive
approach in uncertain times. With average dividend yields
around 3% in our selection, these stocks offer returns
that currently exceed Swiss franc bonds. We have selected
Swiss companies that generally maintain strong balance
sheets and profitability, supporting sustainable market-wide
distributions. While yield is important, the growth factor also
plays a crucial role; dividends are considered high quality
when they are sustainable and growing. Therefore, Swiss
dividend-paying equities may offer a steady income stream
and potential for capital appreciation, serving as an option
for managing market volatility.
