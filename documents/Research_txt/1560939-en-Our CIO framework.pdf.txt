One of the most important lessons I have learnt in over two 
decades as an equity investor in a macro fund is surprising 
given our industry’s structure.

In 1999, as a new trader, I was welcomed into the firm with a 
copy of Larry Livingston’s “Reminiscences of a Stock Opera-
tor.” On my first read through, I circled the phrase “A stock 
operator has to fight a lot of expensive enemies,” not fully 
aware of who or what these “expensive enemies” were.

Over the next 25 years while working in different investing 
roles, I made sense of it: They are the blind spots that emerge 
when analyzing the market from a single perspective. The 
stock market is elusive—once you think you have understood 
its drivers, they change.

In the late 90s, equity investors had to understand the trans-
formational power of the internet. Then, in the 2000s, the 
stock market rewarded those who pivoted their focus to the 
impact of higher rates and company valuations.

More recently, investors had to contend with higher interest 
rates, the result of the enormous fiscal and monetary stimulus 
unleashed during the pandemic. This shifted the digital accel-
eration narrative to one about the higher opportunity cost of 
capital. It also sparked the regional banking sector crisis in early 
2023, which was in large part the echo of the idea (or hope) 
that real rates would forever be zero. Fundamental analysis of 
bank balance sheets, especially the duration mismatch 
between assets and liabilities, helped draw awareness to the 
potential for broader financial risks.

Now, with the launch of ChatGPT, we are in the era of genera-
tive AI. This technology has ushered in an innovation cycle 
that, in the eyes of the stock market so far, has trumped the 
expected slowdown in economic growth. 

It’s difficult to predict when the market perspective will shift. 
Having multiple relevant perspectives in mind helps navigate this 
dynamic. For equity investing, I have found the three most rel-
evant perspectives to be: 1) macro, 2) micro (including company-
specific drivers), 3) transformational (structural changes). What is 
interesting is that these views are isolated from each other by the 
institutional structure of our industry—there are macro funds, 
equity funds, and sector funds, each looking at the market from 
a siloed perspective.

In my experience, a combination of these three investment per-
spectives is key to achieving superior equity returns. Seeing 
multiple perspectives is like juggling balls in the air—it requires 
focus. A framework helps keep these distinct viewpoints in 
focus. The three perspectives—macro, micro, and transforma-
tional—serve as the pillars of our new global equity framework.

The state of the economy—measured by GDP, unemployment, 
and inflation—as well as fiscal and monetary policies impact 
equity markets. Of these, real GDP growth has the largest 
influence on stock prices. For the US, according to our analysis, 
real GDP growth explains over 21% of quarterly S&P 500 
returns over the last 30 years (excluding 2020 data).

Another way to look at the impact of economic growth on 
equities is to analyze recessionary periods. Equities rarely go 
down significantly outside of a recession. A drawdown larger 
than 20% only happened three times since 1945 without a 
recession taking place within 12 months (before or after). The 
bear market of 1966 was caused by rising inflation in the wake 

Chapter 1

Macroeconomics
How macro factors affect stock performance

of increased government spending. In 1987, a combination of 
rising rates, program trading, and portfolio insurance triggered 
“Black Monday,” when the Dow Jones fell by 22.6%, the larg-
est one-day percentage decline in history. More recently in 
2022, a combination of post-COVID stimulus, supply chain dis-
ruptions, and soaring commodity prices led to an inflation 
spike. This forced central banks to rapidly increase rates, ulti-
mately resulting in a drawdown of over 20% for the S&P 500. 

From a top-down lens, one of the most important factors for 
making equity market calls is therefore anticipating the direc-
tion of economic growth.

The relationship of equity markets with real rates is more 
nuanced. On average, there is no statistically significant rela-
tionship between real rates and equity market returns. How-
ever, when inflationary expectations pick up, the correlation 
between real rates and quarterly returns turns negative, even if 
not statistically significant.

Just because the linear relationship between equities and real 
rates is weak does not mean that rates are not important for 
equities. At turning points in monetary policy, rates and the 
dot plot play a critical role for equity returns. One such turn-
ing point was 30 November 2021, when Federal Reserve Chair 

Jerome Powell no longer used the word “transitory” to 
describe the high rate of inflation—a clear sign that the Fed 
was shifting to tighter monetary policy. Ten-year interest rates 
rose from 1.5% to close to 4% over the course of 2022, while 
the S&P 500 declined 25%.

Just because the linear relationship 
between equities and real rates is weak 
does not mean that rates are not impor-
tant for equities.

The one statistic that is worth a frequent reminder is that 1% 
of firms have created more than 80% of net wealth in the 
global equity markets over the last 30 years¹. Fig. 5 shows 
just how concentrated the contribution to equity market 
returns has been.

This result holds globally as well: a mere 2.4% of US compa-
nies and 1.4% of non-US firms account for 100% of stock 
market returns¹. The same finding has been corroborated over 
longer periods for the US stock market².

The top wealth creator globally has been Apple, followed by 
Microsoft and Amazon. All three are US companies that have 
harnessed the power of technological innovation to create 
scale platforms under visionary CEOs. Our company-specific 
lens aims to identify incumbents that are well positioned to 
continue to compound their current competitive advantages 
and new companies that may reach a similar scale.

A mere 2.4% of US companies and 
1.4% of non-US firms account for 
100% of stock market returns.

Historically, the stock market has mirrored transformational 
structural changes. The make-up of the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average reflects how the world has changed over the last 127 
years. The name of the index itself speaks to its origins: When 
it was created in 1896, the world had been transformed by 
the Industrial Revolution. The invention of the open-hearth 
furnace by Siemens in 1860 allowed for the mass construction 
of steel, crucial for industrialization and infrastructure expan-
sion. By 1920, a third of the index was made up of steel com-
panies. Over time, with the advent of the automobile follow-
ing the Benz patent motorcar, automotive companies became 
prominent in the index, rising to a third of the constituents by 
1930. In the 2000s, internet companies and, in the wake of 
recombinant DNA, pharma companies took a larger share of 
index membership (see Fig. 7).

Today, we think there are three transformational innovation 
opportunities (TRIOs) that will drive equity markets in the 
coming decade: artificial intelligence, power and resources, 
and longevity.

From 2023 to today, the most dominant structural innovation 
has been generative artificial intelligence (AI), unleashed by 
the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. About half of the 
appreciation in the MSCI World Index since then has been 
driven by leading AI companies. The dividing line between 
winners and losers inside the technology, consumer, and com-
munication services has equally been delineated by AI.

Besides AI, in this year and last, electrification has driven most 
of the returns for the energy, industrials, utilities, materials, and 
real estate sectors, whereas GLP-based obesity drugs have been 
responsible for the biggest gainers in health care. Of the top 10 
best performing stocks in the S&P 500 during the first half of 
this year, five benefit from AI, three from power and resource 
innovation, and one from longevity—combined, they make up 
close to 40% of the stock market’s entire appreciation.

All three of these transformational drivers—AI, power and 
resource innovation, and longevity—are likely to impact global 
equity markets over the next decade. 

It is surprising that this perspective of structural change is the 
least institutionally acknowledged. While there are many 
“macro” funds, there are few “structural alpha” funds that 
invest into the largest transformational structural trends of our 
times. We see an opportunity to closely align our equity invest-
ment decisions with the alpha opportunity stemming from new 
transformational innovation.

All three of these transformational 
drivers—AI, power and resource 
innovation, and longevity—are likely to 
impact global equity markets over the 
next decade.

Our equity preferences are the prism through which we identify 
the areas of the stock market with the highest return potential.

There are many ways to group stocks. Country, industry, and 
style have been the dominant criteria to create baskets of 
stocks, largely a legacy of the factor modeling framework of 
the 1970s.

However, when we break down the performance of the stocks 
in the MSCI All Country Index over the last 21 years, we find 
that only 24% of returns stem from country, industry, and style 
factors and most of the stock performance comes from com-
pany-specific factors. Of these, style factors, such as value, 
growth, small cap, and large cap, only account for 3% of 
returns (see Fig. 9).

For our global equity preferences, we therefore focus on country 
and industry groupings as categories while dedicating more 
attention to structural innovation and tactical opportunities 
backed by strong company fundamentals, based on a universe 
of liquid, commonly known global stock indexes (e.g. MSCI AC 

World) and industry classifications (e.g. International Standard 
Industrial Classification). For each of these categories, we also 
highlight our top stock picks to capture the most stock-specific 
return upside.

We rate our preferences along a five-point grid from Least 
Attractive, Unattractive, Neutral, Attractive, to Most Attractive 
based on the strength and conviction of our return forecasts 
over the next 12 months. These preferences do not take into 
account the likely volatility of returns or how these preferences 
are correlated with each other. Many of the stock groupings 
have overlaps in their members. This means our preferences 
can reflect the same view in different stock baskets. For proper 
portfolio construction, it is key to take into account both the 
risk of and correlation between our preferences.

Our equity preferences are the prism 
through which we identify the areas of 
the stock market with the highest return 
potential.

Bringing our three perspectives together

How we cover equities  |  October 2024  8



We will present our views on equities in three contexts. 

Region / sectors / sub-sectors 
We believe that a global, style-agnostic approach to investing 
will offer the greatest potential for returns in the years ahead. 
We will continue to provide our views on the major regions 
and sectors. Countries and sectors are relevant segments, they 
account for about one fifth of returns within the factor frame-
work. We also see investment opportunities in sub-sectors 
such as the luxury consumer segment, which exhibits differen-
tiated pricing power and high barriers to entry and can span 
different industries.

For each major region and sector, we will also continually 
update our top picks—stocks that we believe offer the best 
prospects in that segment—and the broader list for investors 
looking to build more diversified single stock exposure to that 
region or sector.

Transformational and long-term opportunities
Transformational innovation opportunities 
Idiosyncratic alpha, which is often driven by a firm’s exposure 
to some of the most important transformative innovations of 
the time, has become one of the biggest drivers of equity 
market returns. The performance of companies exposed to AI 
and obesity in recent years reflects this trend.

We see three “Transformational innovation opportunities”—
the TRIOs—that we believe will generate alpha in the years 
ahead. These are AI, Power and Resource Innovation, and 
Longevity, areas that we anticipate the greatest upside, based 
on our assessment of the addressable market and of the 
potential for companies to earn meaningful profits. 

For each TRIO, we will continually update a stock list of com-
panies and top picks that we think are best positioned to per-
form in each space. We will also update our views on which 
TRIO is best placed at the current point in the cycle.

Longer-term investment opportunities 
TRIOs cover broad areas of potential opportunity and could 
encompass many themes or sub-industries. For example, 
within the broad AI opportunity set, we see opportunities in 
areas like data, cybersecurity, and fintech. 

“Longer-term investment” (LTI) ideas cover these more specific 
opportunities. While, by virtue of its longer-term nature, our 
LTI shelf will not change much month to month, we will 
endeavor to share our views on which LTIs look best posi-
tioned at that moment.

For each LTI, we maintain a broad list of companies with the 
most material exposure to it. And when specific opportunities 
emerge, we will provide more focused list of relevant stocks 
with the highest potential to profit from them.

Tactical opportunities
In the shorter term, tactical opportunities can arise based on, 
for example, changes in macroeconomic policy, shifts in cur-
rency markets, a new geopolitical situation, or economic trends. 

For each “tactical opportunity,” we will update a stock list and 
top picks for investors looking to build single stock exposure to 
that opportunity.

approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing consider-
ations may inhibit UBS’s ability to participate in or to advise on certain investment opportunities that otherwise would be consistent 
with the Client’s investment objectives. The returns on a portfolio incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations 
may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered by UBS, and the 
investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ.
