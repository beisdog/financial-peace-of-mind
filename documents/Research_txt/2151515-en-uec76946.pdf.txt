Q1: direct impact of tariffs "contained"

Messaging from management encouraging.
The message from management at Q1 was that the prior commentary, as things 
currently stand, still applies.  Uncertainties remain on tariffs, but the direct impact should 
be "contained" in the current tariff scenario.  The supply chain continues to work in line 
with plan, and all aspects of guidance including deliveries and EBIT are reiterated with 
caveats that the situation remans fluid. Given the level of uncertainty amongst investors 
this is likely to be taken positively in our view.  We cut our estimates entirely due to 
currency moves which, along with changes in peer multiples, drives our price target to 
€155 from €175.

Tariff impact muted
Management language on tariffs was as encouraging as could be expected.  The direct 
costs of the tariffs should be small and be able to be mitigated under their current scope, 
especially as Airbus believes it may be able to ship to its Chinese FAL tariff free.  Although 
the indirect impacts are still hard to size management also sounded optimistic here, 
reiterating commentary from aerospace peers that the supply chain continues to 
operate as usual, and whilst Airbus continues to probe deep into the supply chain for 
issues, so far few have been seen and inventory buffers are relatively high.  Delivery rates 
will be weak in Q2, with delivery seasonality further shifted to H2 in 2025, but this is 
consistent with the plan at the start of the year.

Results in line
Q1 results themselves were in line, with EBIT 1% ahead of consensus.   Cash flow of 
€310m was significantly ahead of VA cons  -1.7bn likely due to strong pre-delivery 
payments taken in the quarter due to high orders, good production progress with 
milestones hit, and strength across all divisions. 

Valuation: PT lowered to €155
We make minor non-fx updates to our model since results were largely in line.  However 
given recent dollar moves, as well as shifts in the fx forward curve, we cut our 2030 
EPS estimates 11%.  This is the largest driver of our price target  falling to €155 from 
€175 previously, although the decline in peer multiples is also a driver.

Company Description

Airbus Group has three divisions: (1) Airbus Commercial, currently one of two manufacturers 
of 120-plus-seat civil aircraft and military transport aircraft; (2) Airbus Helicopters, a leading 
helicopter company, previously named Eurocopter; and (3) Airbus Defence & Space, which 
develops and manufactures a range of defence and security platforms and products, 
including fighter aircraft, missiles (via its 37.5% stake in MBDA), UAVs, defence electronics, 
space transportation, and satellites and satellite services. Airbus also owns 50% of ATR, a 
turboprop aircraft manufacturer.

Valuation Method and Risk Statement

Airbus profits are very sensitive to production volumes and to movements in the €/US$ 
exchange rate. These are very difficult to predict and consequently any changes in these 
factors can have a significant effect on forecasts. In addition, Airbus’ defence operations are 
dependent upon government expenditure and the company’s ability to successfully execute 
on contracts. Again, both of these are subject to change. Our 12-month price target is based 
on DCF and multiple analysis.

KEY DEFINITIONS: Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over 
the next 12 months. In some cases, this yield may be based on accrued dividends. Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as 
the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a forecast of, the equity risk premium). Under Review (UR) 
Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are subject to possible change in the 
near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. Short-Term Ratings reflect the expected 
near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months.

EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES: UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors 
such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Sell: Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. Core 
Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review Consultation (IRC). 
Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's debt. As a result, stocks 
deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rating. When such exceptions apply, 
they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.

Investing in structured investments involves significant risks. For a detailed discussion of the risks involved in investing in any particular structured investment, you must read 
the relevant offering materials for that investment. Structured investments are unsecured obligations of a particular issuer with returns linked to the performance of an 
underlying asset. Depending on the terms of the investment, investors could lose all or a substantial portion of their investment based on the performance of the underlying 
asset. Investors could also lose their entire investment if the issuer becomes insolvent. UBS does not guarantee in any way the obligations or the financial condition of any 
issuer or the accuracy of any financial information provided by any issuer. Structured investments are not traditional investments and investing in a structured investment is 
not equivalent to investing directly in the underlying asset. Structured investments may have limited or no liquidity, and investors should be prepared to hold their investment 
to maturity. The return of structured investments may be limited by a maximum gain, participation rate or other feature. Structured investments may include call features and, 
if a structured investment is called early, investors would not earn any further return and may not be able to reinvest in similar investments with similar terms. Structured 
investments include costs and fees which are generally embedded in the price of the investment. The tax treatment of a structured investment may be complex and may differ 
from a direct investment in the underlying asset. UBS and its employees do not provide tax advice. Investors should consult their own tax advisor about their own tax situation 
before investing in any securities.

Important Information About Sustainable Investing Strategies: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and incorporate environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) factors into investment process and portfolio construction. Strategies across geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. 
Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio manager’s ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise 
would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing 
considerations may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered by the portfolio manager, and the 
investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ.
