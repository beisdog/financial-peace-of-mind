Dana Inc.
2025 outlook and OH sale process intact

We remain very constructive on DAN and raise our price target to $20 and our 
2025 EBITDA forecast 16% following greater clarity on tariff impact. In our 
view, DAN remains the best set-up in autos seeing a large transfer of value to 
the equity from the potential sale of their Off-highway business, cost 
reductions at RemainCo, and a business that is relatively insulated from tariff 
risk. We heard a number of updates from the 1Q25 call that were positive:

� OH deal soon. Confirmation that OH sales process underway with multiple 
bidders. As moving past max tariff uncertainty, potential buyers spending more 
time with DAN. OH has minimal tariff impact so shouldn’t impact process. 
Management did hedge a little and say deal announcement late 2Q (not a big deal 
in our view). We’d expect an announcement in the next 2-6 weeks. 

� 2025 guidance reiterated. Sales guided towards higher end of range with tariff 
pass-through, FX offsetting slightly lower market outlook. EBITDA guidance 
reiterated with higher cost saving and tariff recoveries offsetting volume. See our 
bridges inside. Management not seeing any change in orders for light trucks. NA 
CV market is softer offset by SA and EU. OH a little better than prior with some 
green-shoots outside of NA (so little change to prior OH guidance that buyers are 
likely looking at). Because of higher cost saves, if they didn’t have that tariff 
uncertainty on volumes they would have raised guidance by $50mm. 2025 
guidance was ~10% above consensus estimates. See 1Q25 and guidance review 
inside. 

� Tariff situation manageable. Secured recoveries w/customers. Higher NA steel/
aluminum prices as a result of tariffs already have mechanisms in place, but could 
have some timing lag. Their LV biz main programs (Super Duty, Bronco, Wrangler, 
Ranger) all US. 

� Cost savings accelerated. Now expect $225mm of $300mm this year (from 
$175mm prior). 70% is engineering headcount. 10% is streamlining from 
consolidating Power Technologies into LVS and CVS segments. Further 
opportunity from taking best practices and processes from LVS to old PT biz. 

� Other cash benefits. 1) Sold non-core assets for $50mm pre-tax proceeds (little 
sales/EBITDA impact since some were unconsolidated JVs). 2) See opportunity for 
another $50mm in non-core proceeds in 2H25. 

Valuation: Our new PT is $20 from $18.  
We apply 4.5x EV/EBITDA to our PF 2026E EBITDA forecast and use a 6x EV/EBITDA 
multiple for the sale of the OH business.

1Q25 Review 
� DAN reported 1Q25 sales of $2.4bn (-14% y/y). Lower sales were driven by -

$347mm vol/mix due to lower sales in all end markets, -$53mm from FX, -$10mm 
from commodities.This was slightly offset by +$27mm of performance. 

� EBITDA-adj was $188mm (-15.7% y/y, 8% margin), driven by -$90mm lower vol/
mix, -$6mm tariff cost, -$4mm FX and -$11mm from commodities. This was 
slightly offset by +$35mm of performance and +$41mm of cost savings. 

� EPS less important for DAN, but was $0.13, higher than the $0.08/$0.12 estimates 
from UBS/consensus.

� FCF was ($101mm) which is a ~$67mm improvement y/y. 1Q is typically a seasonal 
outflow quarter.

2025 Guide 
� 2025 sales guide remains $9.5bn-$10bn, although management believes they are 

tracking towards the higher end of the range. If we assume FX is now a $30mm 
tailwind to the guide (prior -$195mm headwind), commodities are now a $40mm 
headwind ($30mm headwind prior) and tariffs are a $120mm tailwind, this would 
imply management is now looking for volume ~$235mm lower vs their prior 
guide. 

� By segment DAN continues to expect LV volumes flat y/y. They have not seen 
anything in 1Q and no indication that OEMs are planning for any significant 
volume drop off. In CV, management did highlight that the outlook does look 
worse vs their prior guidance. While on OH they have seen some pre-buy in 1Q 
driven by some of their customers looking to take delivery ahead of tariffs. They 
are also seeing some green shoots in Europe.  

� EBITDA guidance for the year was unchanged at $925-$1,025, although DAN 
accelerated their cost saving program, and now expect to take out $225mm this 
year vs $175mm prior. DAN does expect to recover 100% of the tariff impact, but 
this could be on a lag. 

� EPS guide lowered to $1.15-$1.65 from $1.40-$1.90 prior driven by tax impacts 
on regional profit mix. 

� FCF was unchanged at $175-$225mm.

KEY DEFINITIONS: Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over 
the next 12 months. In some cases, this yield may be based on accrued dividends. Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as 
the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a forecast of, the equity risk premium). Under Review (UR) 
Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are subject to possible change in the 
near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. Short-Term Ratings reflect the expected 
near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months.

EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES: UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors 
such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Sell: Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. Core 
Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review Consultation (IRC). 
Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's debt. As a result, stocks 
deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rating. When such exceptions apply, 
they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.

and may be appropriate only for sophisticated investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, and for the complete risks relating to options, you must receive a 
copy of "The Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options." You may read the document at https://www.theocc.com/publications/risks/riskchap1.jsp or ask 
your salesperson for a copy. Various theoretical explanations of the risks associated with these instruments have been published. Supporting documentation for 
any claims, comparisons, recommendations, statistics or other technical data will be supplied upon request. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of 
future results. Transaction costs may be significant in option strategies calling for multiple purchases and sales of options, such as spreads and straddles. Because 
of the importance of tax considerations to many options transactions, the investor considering options should consult with his/her tax advisor as to how taxes 
affect the outcome of contemplated options transactions.
Mortgage and asset-backed securities may involve a high degree of risk and may be highly volatile in response to fluctuations in interest rates or other market 
conditions. Foreign currency rates of exchange may adversely affect the value, price or income of any security or related instrument referred to in the document. 
For investment advice, trade execution or other enquiries, clients should contact their local sales representative.

labelling or similar standards that may exist under the ESG Regimes. UBS has not conducted any assessment of compliance with ESG Regimes. Parties are 
reminded to make their own assessments for these purposes.
The value of any investment or income may go down as well as up, and investors may not get back the full (or any) amount invested. Past performance is not 
necessarily a guide to future performance. Neither UBS nor any of its directors, employees or agents accepts any liability for any loss (including investment loss) or 
damage arising out of the use of all or any of the Information.

buying or selling an option, and for the complete risks relating to options, you must receive a copy of "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options". You may read the 
document at  https://www.theocc.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp  or ask your financial advisor for a copy.

Investing in structured investments involves significant risks. For a detailed discussion of the risks involved in investing in any particular structured investment, you must read 
the relevant offering materials for that investment. Structured investments are unsecured obligations of a particular issuer with returns linked to the performance of an 
underlying asset. Depending on the terms of the investment, investors could lose all or a substantial portion of their investment based on the performance of the underlying 
asset. Investors could also lose their entire investment if the issuer becomes insolvent. UBS does not guarantee in any way the obligations or the financial condition of any 
issuer or the accuracy of any financial information provided by any issuer. Structured investments are not traditional investments and investing in a structured investment is 
not equivalent to investing directly in the underlying asset. Structured investments may have limited or no liquidity, and investors should be prepared to hold their investment 
to maturity. The return of structured investments may be limited by a maximum gain, participation rate or other feature. Structured investments may include call features and, 
if a structured investment is called early, investors would not earn any further return and may not be able to reinvest in similar investments with similar terms. Structured 
investments include costs and fees which are generally embedded in the price of the investment. The tax treatment of a structured investment may be complex and may differ 
from a direct investment in the underlying asset. UBS and its employees do not provide tax advice. Investors should consult their own tax advisor about their own tax situation 
before investing in any securities.

Important Information About Sustainable Investing Strategies: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and incorporate environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) factors into investment process and portfolio construction. Strategies across geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. 
Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio manager’s ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise 
would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing 
considerations may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered by the portfolio manager, and the 
investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ.
