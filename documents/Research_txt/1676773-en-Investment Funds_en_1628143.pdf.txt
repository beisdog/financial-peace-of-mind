Robeco Smart Energy

Our Chief Investment Office (CIO) believes the power and resources field is set for transformational growth,
offering significant investment opportunities across power generation, grid infrastructure, and natural
resources as the world adapts to increasing electricity demand. The rise of AI data centers, industrial
electrification, electric vehicles, and global climate goals is increasing electricity demand. CIO estimates that
electrifying our economy will require USD 3 trillion annually by 2030, benefiting companies in power and
resource innovation.

One of our solutions for an investment in this theme is the Robeco Smart Energy Equities Fund. This solution offers
the following characteristics:
• Product: The fund invests worldwide in companies that benefit from the transformation of the global energy sector

towards clean energy sources, energy efficiency and smart mobility solutions

• Portfolio: 40-70 cyclical, higher growth stocks and also exposure to small caps

• Team: The fund is managed by experts in the energy or alternative energy fields

• Attractively priced negotiated shareclasses for contracted clients

Risks: The fund invests in equities and may therefore be subject to high fluctuations in value. For this reason, an investment
horizon of at least five years is required. Focusing intentionally on stocks within certain themes may come with further
risks. Additional information about these and other risks can be found in the KID as well as in the prospectus of the fund.
Past performance is no indication of future results.
