Long Term AI Revenue Vectors the Highlight

Key Takeaways
The positive surprise was that Meta continues to drive efficiencies on costs - both on 
deprecation & infrastructure costs as well as employee costs. In an environment in which  
ad budgets appear to have challenges ahead, the ability to cut costs while continuing to 
invest for genAI growth was unexpected. And ultimately, with management deftly 
navigating the macro environment by also creating a leverage buffer to soften any 
potential near-term revenue shocks, this leaves investors ample room to refocus on the 
long-term new revenue vectors we have been excited about - Business AI chatbots and 
Meta AI search ads. Compounding signs of overall macro weakness leave our revenue 
estimates largely unchanged, but improved OpEx projections drive up our 2026 / 2027 
EPS estimates by 4% / 6%, leading to a 5% increase in our price target to $683.  We 
maintain our Buy rating on META shares given intact path to lighting up several new 
revenue vectors.

Upside Case
Bulls will  argue: 1) 1Q25 results beat with revenue/ EPS $42.3B / $6.43 ahead  vs 
consensus $41.3B / $5.24;  2) ad impression growth of 5% YOY across Family of Apps, 
alongside ongoing pricing benefit on targeting improvements; 3) 2025 Total Expenses 
guide reduced to $113B-$118B from $114B-$119B despite increased 2025 CapEx 
guide as well as better 1Q25 operating income suggests cost controls offseting some 
margin pressure; 4) Meta AI hitting 1B MAU and rollout of standalone Meta AI app likely 
to boost chatbot usage and support LT incremental revenue stream;  4)  new Advantage+ 
updates leaves headroom for greater adoption of this product among larger cohort of 
SMBs; and 5) Threads should start adding to revenue generation  with ads being added 
to surface this year; and 6) AI Business Messaging, Meta AI, and Studio AI remain 
midterm needle-moving products to monetize. Quantitatively, our upside scenario is 
$960/share (66% upside potential) - 2-Year revenue CAGR of 14%, and 2Q26-1Q27E 
operating margin of 42%, implying 2Q26-1Q27E EPS of $33.82,  on a 28x P/E multiple.

Downside Case
Bears will  argue: 1) 2Q25 revenue guidance of $42.5B-$45.5B, or $44.0B at midpoint  is 
in line with St's $44.1B and does little to soothe concerns of worsening macroeconomic 
and advertising budget backdrop for 2025; 2) 2025 CapEx guide raised to $64B-$72B 
from $60B-$65B suggests higher near-term capital intensity and was not expected by 
investors; 3) mgmt. noted that overall spend from Asia-based exporters, which we 
believe to be Temu / Shein largely, is globally tracking below previous levels despite some 
of the US pulled back ad spend being moved to other geographies - this is likely to raise 
questions about 2H25 growth rates, especially given that Meta has been the largest

beneficiary of this demand bucket (to the tune of ~$18B of revenues in 2025); 4) return 
on investment timeframe  for genAI CapEx unresolved with CEO noting that usage not 
revenue will be focus for Meta AI at least for the next year; and 5) limited resolution on 
DMA finding as well as ongoing US court case. Quantitatively, our downside scenario is 
$461/share (20% downside potential) - 2-Year revenue CAGR of 10%, and 2Q26-
1Q27E operating margin of 34%, implying 2Q26-1Q27E EPS of $25.62,  on a 18x P/
E multiple.

Valuation
We increase our price target to $683 (from $650) on   24x (unchanged) our full year 
ending 1Q27E GAAP diluted EPS of $27.99 (earlier $26.66). Please note that the EPS 
shown on the front cover is UBS-adjusted EPS and differs from the company's disclosed 
GAAP diluted EPS.

Investment Case: Long Term AI Revenue Vectors the Highlight

Meta reported 1Q25 Revenue and GAAP diluted EPS of $42.3B  and $6.43 versus UBSe 
$41.1B and $5.23 and consensus $41.3B and $5.24, respectively. As we flow through 
the reported results and make changes to our estimates, our GAAP diluted EPS for 
2025E, 2026E, and 2027E are now $24.80, $27.30 and $30.81 versus prior $23.34, 
$26.15, and $29.13, respectively. Our price target is now $683 versus $650 prior.

Meta delivered a beat on 1Q25 revenue and EPS, with the company noting ad 
impressions increased 5% YOY, compared to 6% YOY growth in 4Q24. We note that 
Google Search & other paid clicks were up 2% YOY in 1Q25 versus in the range of 4-6% 
YOY growth each quarter through 2024. On the advertising industry outlook, Meta 
flagged broad-based strength across verticals in 1Q25 with the exceptions being gaming 
(negative YOY growth driven by lower spend from China-based advertisers who 
promoted some gaming titles in 1Q24) and Politics (due to completion of US Elections). 
Said another way, it  appears that Meta's ad business is benefiting more so than others in 
the space from its improvements to its ad tech stack since the COVID recession - and 
therefore we expect Meta to continue to gain share even if digital budgets are squeezed 
through 2025. 

For April, Mgmt. noted that overall ad spend from Asia-based exporters, which we 
believe to be largely Temu / Shein, is globally tracking below previous levels despite some 
of the US pulled back ad spend being moved to other geographies - this is likely to raise 
questions about 2H25 growth rates, especially given that Meta has been the largest 
beneficiary of this demand bucket (to the tune of ~$18B of revenues in 2025). All of this 
being said, Meta guided 2Q25 revenue at $42.5B-$45.5B, which at midpoint of $44.0B 
is above UBSe $43.8B and in line with consensus $44.1B. Despite the in-line 2Q25 
guide, we would be remiss in not factoring in signs that macro conditions have 
weakened further in April versus 1Q25 and there is uncertainty around 2H25 ad 
budgets. Therefore, we do not view digital ad budgets as fully insulated for the rest of 
the year.

On the cost side, management reduced guidance for 2025 total expenses to $113B-
$118B from $114B-$119B, while raising CapEx guide to $64B-$72B from $60B-$65B. 
The $1B cut to the midpoint of total cost guide despite the $5.5B increase in CapEx 
guide - which should drive a $1B increase in depreciation expense flowthrough for the 
year given that the 5.5 year useful life on new technical infrastructure - suggests a $2B 
annual runrate improvement in costs. Meta mgmt. noted some of the cost benefits are 
coming from updated expectations for employee compensation. Meta has since late 
2022 had a efficiency ethos and this update suggests to us Meta might lead vs GOOG 
and AMZN in showing headcount and employee cost control to offset GPU-buildout 
related deleverage. We also think part of the improvements are likely coming from 
quicker-than-expected improvements in costs to run genAI infrastructure - something 
we flagged even in Alphabet's results and a cost benefit that we see as sustainable over 
time. 

Net/net, our 2025, 2026, and 2027 GAAP diluted EPS estimates are now $24.80, 
$27.30 and $30.81 versus prior $23.34, $26.15, and $29.13, respectively. Applying an 
unchanged P/E multiple of 24x to our 2Q26-1Q27E GAAP diluted EPS, our price target 
moves to $683 from $650.

We maintain our Buy rating, with key points of our investment thesis being:

� Business AI chatbots enabling increased utilization and increased per conversation 
revenue from messaging ads

� Consumer-facing Meta AI chatbots across WhatsApp / Instagram / Facebook as 
well as the Meta AI standalone app, allowing Meta to foray into search ads - in 
effect replicating a revenue stream that TikTok and Snap (vis-à-vis its My AI 
chatbot) have been showcasing

� Influencer-facing chatbots deepening engagement across Meta platforms, thus 
allowing Meta to deliver more ads across its monetized surfaces (similar to the 
phenomenon seen with Reels)

� Gen AI leveling up Meta's ability to deliver creative and placement automation

Valuation  – Price Target to $683 (from $650) and skew of 3.2x

Our price target altered to $683 (from $650) and is based on 24x (unchanged) our 
revised full year ending 1Q27 GAAP diluted EPS estimate of $27.99 (versus $26.66 
prior). 

Our 24x multiple is line with Meta's 2Q20-4Q21 average. We think the 24x multiple is 
justified as covers the multiple that Meta traded at during the early days of COVID which 
reflected budget revision fears, similar to our feedback from advertisers currently with 
our ad checks mirroring the general operating environment uncertainty that the ad 
market was facing in those early days of the pandemic. The multiple also accounts for 
Meta's trading multiple during peak COVID, which more so reflected the benefit for 
digital players as consumers under lockdown shopped largely online. While we 
recognise that there is potential for any macro downturn this year to be different to the 
situation during COVID, we think the 24x  balances deteriorating market conditions vs 
Meta's improved ad tech stack (now versus five years ago with COVID). Hence the 
market share gains - borne primarily from product development - that Meta has 
garnered appear sticky to us. The multiple also reflects the greater confidence we have 
gained through 2024 in Meta's ability to potentially deliver ROIC against its Gen AI 
CapEx and therefore support market share gains for longer.

Upside / Downside Case

For Meta, our upside / downside scenarios imply a skew of 3.2x

Upside Case ($960): Our upside scenario assumes Meta sees an acceleration in 2-Year 
revenue CAGR to 14% vs 12% in our base case. We estimate 2Q26-1Q27 operating 
margin of 42% vs 36% in our base case. This implies 2Q26-1Q27 GAAP diluted EPS of 
$33.82, which on a 28x P/E multiple equates to a valuation of $960.

Base Case ($683): Our base scenario assumes Meta sees a 2-Year revenue CAGR of 
12%. We estimate 2Q26-1Q27 operating margin of 36%. This implies 2Q26-1Q27 
GAAP diluted EPS of $27.99, which on a 24x P/E multiple equates to a valuation of 
$683.

Downside Case ($461): Our downside scenario assumes Meta sees a deceleration in 2-
Year revenue CAGR growth to 12% vs 10% in our base case. We estimate 2Q26-1Q27 
operating margin of 34% vs 36% in our base case. This implies 2Q26-1Q27 GAAP 
diluted EPS of $25.62, which on an 18x P/E multiple equates to a valuation of $461.

Company Description

Meta Platforms Inc. operates a number of platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and 
WhatsApp, that allow users to engage and communicate with one another via social media/
messaging, as well as Facebook Reality Labs, focused on building out AR/VR capabilities.

Valuation Method and Risk Statement

Our valuation is based on a multiple of GAAP EPS. Key risks to the downside include: (1) a 
pullback in advertising more broadly; (2) impacts from iOS changes related to ad targeting 
and measurement; (3) changes to the regulatory landscape and how antitrust laws are 
interpreted; (4) headwinds related to user growth and engagement associated with 
competitor platforms like TikTok; (5) engagement shifts to lower monetizing portions of the 
app (e.g. Reels) and uncertainty around the long-term monetization potential of new 
formats; (6) heavy investment into Reality Labs with an uncertain outcome and lack of a 
product/market fit today.

KEY DEFINITIONS: Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over 
the next 12 months. In some cases, this yield may be based on accrued dividends. Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as 
the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a forecast of, the equity risk premium). Under Review (UR) 
Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are subject to possible change in the 
near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. Short-Term Ratings reflect the expected 
near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months.

EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES: UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors 
such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Sell: Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. Core 
Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review Consultation (IRC). 
Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's debt. As a result, stocks 
deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rating. When such exceptions apply, 
they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.

Investing in structured investments involves significant risks. For a detailed discussion of the risks involved in investing in any particular structured investment, you must read 
the relevant offering materials for that investment. Structured investments are unsecured obligations of a particular issuer with returns linked to the performance of an 
underlying asset. Depending on the terms of the investment, investors could lose all or a substantial portion of their investment based on the performance of the underlying 
asset. Investors could also lose their entire investment if the issuer becomes insolvent. UBS does not guarantee in any way the obligations or the financial condition of any 
issuer or the accuracy of any financial information provided by any issuer. Structured investments are not traditional investments and investing in a structured investment is 
not equivalent to investing directly in the underlying asset. Structured investments may have limited or no liquidity, and investors should be prepared to hold their investment 
to maturity. The return of structured investments may be limited by a maximum gain, participation rate or other feature. Structured investments may include call features and, 
if a structured investment is called early, investors would not earn any further return and may not be able to reinvest in similar investments with similar terms. Structured 
investments include costs and fees which are generally embedded in the price of the investment. The tax treatment of a structured investment may be complex and may differ 
from a direct investment in the underlying asset. UBS and its employees do not provide tax advice. Investors should consult their own tax advisor about their own tax situation 
before investing in any securities.

Important Information About Sustainable Investing Strategies: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and incorporate environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) factors into investment process and portfolio construction. Strategies across geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. 
Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio manager’s ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise 
would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing 
considerations may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered by the portfolio manager, and the 
investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ.

Within the past 12 months UBS Switzerland AG, its affiliates or subsidiaries may have received or provided investment services and activities or ancillary services as per MiFID 
II which may have given rise to a payment or promise of a payment in relation to these services from or to this company.
