and "Consumer experiences" LTI themes into

• As our Longer Term Investments themes E-
commerce, Consumer experiences, and Metaverse
have common drivers around digitalization and
impact from AI, we are integrating them into our
new Longer Term Investments theme The digital
consumer.

• In our broader The digital consumer LTI, we
offer a holistic outlook about the old and
new ways consumers are consuming goods and
products. Consumer behavior is shifting toward
consumer experiences with people spending more
on experiences that create lasting memories and
happiness.

• Technology and society are the main structural
drivers of the theme. Population growth is an
important driver of consumption growth.

• Technology is revolutionizing every aspect of our
lives, enabling new experiences. Social media
networks are growing vibrantly as increasingly many
people want to be part of a community and share
their experiences.

Our view
Technology has revolutionized how we work, play, and
consume as it disrupts many aspects of our lives and
creates new virtual experiences. The growth of the digital
economy has disrupted many traditional business models in
the past 20 years. Companies like Meta, YouTube, Amazon
Web Services, and Android's/Apple's smartphone operating
systems, to mention a few, all emerged within a few
years of one another and quickly rewrote the rules. The
emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) can positively impact

consumer experiences by enhancing customer support,
improving content creation, aiding education and training,
or contributing to immersive gaming.

There has also been a shift in consumer behavior
worldwide, in the way people consume products, use the
internet for information, and ultimately make decisions.
Digital innovation and changing consumption patterns will
continue to drive structural growth in the digital economy
and create investment opportunities, in our view. In this
report, we review the latest developments in the industry.

This report has been prepared by UBS Switzerland AG, UBS Financial Services Inc. (UBS FS). Please see important
disclaimers and disclosures at the end of the document.

Younger generations are digital natives and show
consumption patterns that are different from those of
their parents, while also affecting their parents' behavior.
Consumer decisions are being influenced increasingly by
more touchpoints than in the past thanks to digitalization,
which is rewriting the playbook for online businesses. For
young people, sharing or spending on experiences tends to
be more important than owning things.

Traditional areas (travel and leisure), in combination with
emerging virtual segments (metaverse, games, e-sports,
online events around art, sports, culture, and entertainment,
and social media), are a key investment opportunity in
this theme, in our view. As a result, we are closing our
Longer Term Investments themes E-commerce, Consumer
experiences, and Metaverse, and integrating them into our
new Longer Term Investments theme The digital consumer.

Risk information
UBS Chief Investment Office's ("CIO") investment views are prepared and published by the Global Wealth Management
business of UBS Switzerland AG (regulated by FINMA in Switzerland) or its affiliates ("UBS"), part of UBS Group AG ("UBS
Group"). UBS Group includes former Credit Suisse AG, its subsidiaries, branches and affiliates. Additional disclaimer relevant
to Credit Suisse Wealth Management follows at the end of this section.
The investment views have been prepared in accordance with legal requirements designed to promote the independence
of investment research.
Generic investment research – Risk information:
This publication is for your information only and is not intended as an offer, or a solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell
any investment or other specific product. The analysis contained herein does not constitute a personal recommendation or
take into account the particular investment objectives, investment strategies, financial situation and needs of any specific
recipient. It is based on numerous assumptions. Different assumptions could result in materially different results. Certain
services and products are subject to legal restrictions and cannot be offered worldwide on an unrestricted basis and/or may
not be eligible for sale to all investors. All information and opinions expressed in this document were obtained from sources
believed to be reliable and in good faith, but no representation or warranty, express or implied, is made as to its accuracy
or completeness (other than disclosures relating to UBS). All information and opinions as well as any forecasts, estimates
and market prices indicated are current as of the date of this report, and are subject to change without notice. Opinions
expressed herein may differ or be contrary to those expressed by other business areas or divisions of UBS as a result of
using different assumptions and/or criteria. UBS may utilise artificial intelligence tools (“AI Tools”) in the preparation of this
document. Notwithstanding any such use of AI Tools, this document has undergone human review.
In no circumstances may this document or any of the information (including any forecast, value, index or other calculated
amount ("Values")) be used for any of the following purposes (i) valuation or accounting purposes; (ii) to determine the
amounts due or payable, the price or the value of any financial instrument or financial contract; or (iii) to measure the
performance of any financial instrument including, without limitation, for the purpose of tracking the return or performance
of any Value or of defining the asset allocation of portfolio or of computing performance fees. By receiving this document
and the information you will be deemed to represent and warrant to UBS that you will not use this document or otherwise
rely on any of the information for any of the above purposes. UBS and any of its directors or employees may be entitled at
any time to hold long or short positions in investment instruments referred to herein, carry out transactions involving relevant
investment instruments in the capacity of principal or agent, or provide any other services or have officers, who serve as
directors, either to/for the issuer, the investment instrument itself or to/for any company commercially or financially affiliated
to such issuers. At any time, investment decisions (including whether to buy, sell or hold securities) made by UBS and its
employees may differ from or be contrary to the opinions expressed in UBS research publications. Some investments may not
be readily realizable since the market in the securities is illiquid and therefore valuing the investment and identifying the risk
to which you are exposed may be difficult to quantify. UBS relies on information barriers to control the flow of information
contained in one or more areas within UBS, into other areas, units, divisions or affiliates of UBS. Futures and options trading
is not suitable for every investor as there is a substantial risk of loss, and losses in excess of an initial investment may occur.
Past performance of an investment is no guarantee for its future performance. Additional information will be made available
upon request. Some investments may be subject to sudden and large falls in value and on realization you may receive back
less than you invested or may be required to pay more. Changes in foreign exchange rates may have an adverse effect on
the price, value or income of an investment. The analyst(s) responsible for the preparation of this report may interact with
trading desk personnel, sales personnel and other constituencies for the purpose of gathering, synthesizing and interpreting
market information.
Different areas, groups, and personnel within UBS Group may produce and distribute separate research products
independently of each other. For example, research publications from CIO are produced by UBS Global Wealth
Management. UBS Global Research is produced by UBS Investment Bank. Research methodologies and rating systems
of each separate research organization may differ, for example, in terms of investment recommendations, investment
horizon, model assumptions, and valuation methods. As a consequence, except for certain economic forecasts (for which
UBS CIO and UBS Global Research may collaborate), investment recommendations, ratings, price targets, and valuations
provided by each of the separate research organizations may be different, or inconsistent. You should refer to each relevant
research product for the details as to their methodologies and rating system. Not all clients may have access to all products
from every organization. Each research product is subject to the policies and procedures of the organization that produces it.
The compensation of the analyst(s) who prepared this report is determined exclusively by research management and senior
management (not including investment banking). Analyst compensation is not based on investment banking, sales and
trading or principal trading revenues, however, compensation may relate to the revenues of UBS Group as a whole, of which
investment banking, sales and trading and principal trading are a part.
Tax treatment depends on the individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future. UBS does not provide
legal or tax advice and makes no representations as to the tax treatment of assets or the investment returns thereon both in

Important Information About Sustainable Investing Strategies: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider
and incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into investment process and portfolio construction.
Strategies across geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. Incorporating ESG
factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit UBS’s ability to participate in or to advise on certain investment
opportunities that otherwise would be consistent with the Client’s investment objectives. The returns on a portfolio
incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors,
exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered by UBS, and the investment opportunities available to such
portfolios may differ.
