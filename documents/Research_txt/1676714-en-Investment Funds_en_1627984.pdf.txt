VanEck Global Mining ETF
18 June 2025, 08:43 UTC, written by Jon Andrea Barblan

Our Chief Investment Office (CIO) expects gold to build on its gains in 2025. Lower interest rates, persistent
geopolitical risks, and US government debt concerns are contributing to robust central bank and investor
buying. Our CIO also sees long-term opportunities in copper, and in other transition metals as demand increases
alongside rising investment in power generation, storage, and electric transport.

Owing to the complexities of attaining direct exposure to some of these metals, our CIO prefers buying select
miners and processors that have exposure to these metals.

One of our solutions to invest in global mining companies is the VanEck Global Mining ETF. This solution offers the
following characteristics:

• Flexibility of an exchange-traded investment

• Passive and broad global exposure to companies primarily involved in the metal and mineral extraction industries

• High transparency and cost efficiency

Index description:
• The S&P Global Mining Reduced Coal Index measures the returns of global companies primarily involved in the metal

and mineral extraction industries

• The S&P Global Mining Reduced Coal Index is market capitalisation weighted, free float adjusted and covers both
Emerging and Developed Markets

Risks



For UBS Marketing purposes

The fund invests in equities and may therefore be subject to high fluctuations. Investments in emerging market countries
are subject to specific risks and securities are generally less liquid and less efficient and securities markets may be less well
regulated. Specific risks of a Mining ETF may be heightened by currency fluctuations and exchange control; imposition
of restrictions on the repatriation of funds or other assets; governmental interference; higher inflation; social, economic
and political uncertainties. Additional information about these and other risks can be found in the fund's Key Information
Document (KID) and prospectus. Past performance is no indication of future results.
