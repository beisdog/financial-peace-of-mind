Sandoz AG
1Q'25 Results - Second Opinion

UBS View: 1Q sales showed a significant slow down in biosimilar growth. The 
withdrawal of its ranibizumab biosimilar, Cimerli, in the US was an expected headwind 
for 2025, however a material pricing headwind for its US private label adalimumab 
biosimilar was not. Combined with limited sequential growth in the rest of the biosimilar 
portfolio, this leaves significant growth inflection required to reach the group sales 
growth guidance, assuming that growth in the generics portfolio continues to be 
modest/limited (0% CER growth at 1Q). We see positives from the failed J&J preliminary 
injunction on its private label ustekinumab biosimilar and comfort around the limited 
impact from US tariffs if these materialise for pharmaceutical products, but with the 
weakness to biosimilars we remain a Neutral.

Sandoz expect annualised  20% tariff impact of $60-65m 
A potential announcement on US pharmaceutical tariffs, remains an overhang for the 
pharmaceutical sector. For Sandoz, the US only accounted for 18% of FY24 sales. The 
generic and biosimilar industry is reliant on imports of raw materials and active 
pharmaceutical ingredient (API) into the US. Sandoz products are also currently 
imported by partners (e.g. wholesalers and CMOs) which further complicates the tariff 
exposure, but Sandoz expects a very managable $60-65m annualised impact to 
earnings (c.4% of FY26 earnings) from a 20% tariff on EU imports.

Changes to forecasts
We cut our FY25 biosimilar growth at CER to 8.0% (from 19%) and generics growth at 
CER to 2.5% (from 4%), giving group CER sales growth of 4.0% (prev. 8%) vs guidance 
for mid-single digit. Our FY25 EBITDA margin of 21.3% is in-line with guidance for 
around 21%. Our cuts to underlying growth are offset by FX - we update for current 
spot rates that is a material tailwind to Sandoz sales, moving from a -4% headwind to a 
+1.7% tailwind. Overall, this results in a 10% increase to FY25 EPS, but our growth cuts 
result in FY28+ EPS cuts of c.5%. 

We cut our price target to CHF37 (from CHF44)
 We value Sandoz using a 9x 12m forward EV/EBITDA multiple (vs 10.5x previously). The 
>15% cut in our price target is informed by our DCF, where we retain a -1% terminal 
decline assumption  and 9% WACC. The magnitude of the downgrade in our DCF is 
driven by significantly weaker growth outlook for biosimilars, which is a greater longer 
term driver of valuation, with our 2028+ biosimilar gross profit forecasts cut >15%.

Catalysts: May-25 US denosumab (bProlia/Xgeva), 2H25 US natalizumab (bTysabri) and 
4Q25 EU launches of denosumab and aflibercept (bEylea).

Sandoz AG UBS Research

Thesis MapUBS Research THESIS MAP a guide to our thinking and what´s where in this report

Q: Can Sandoz sustain mid-single digit sales growth to 2028? 
Yes, we think that the company can grow the top line at 4.9% CAGR in FY24-28E. Generics will likely 
grow more slowly (UBSe 3.0%) given a more mature industry and the US business recovering from a 
period of underperformance over the past 2-3 years. Biosimilars are a smaller part of the business 
today (28% of FY24 revenues) but will grow faster (UBSe 9.4% FY24-28E CAGR) as the company 
delivers on recent biosimilar launches and new launch opportunities arise.

Q: Can Sandoz hit its 24-26% core EBITDA margin guidance by 2028E?
Yes, we think Sandoz can achieve core EBITDA margin towards the bottom end of its guidance range 
(UBSe 24.0% in FY28E). We believe going further would mean more meaningful cost savings or a 
higher margin contribution from biosimilars. Given some of the potential risks (litigation, 
uncertainties around market formation for individual products), we are inclined to credit further 
margin expansion only on signs of progress.

Q: Is Sandoz well placed to capitalise on the next wave of biosimilar opportunities? 
Yes. Sandoz has one of the largest current portfolios of biosimilars and we expect scale to remain 
important in this market. It has proven market access with number 1 positions on many biosimilars 
across Europe and we have seen strong access for its biosimilars in the US. We see >$110bn of 
branded biologics going off-patent by the end of the decade and expect Sandoz to be a winner in 
biosimilars in the long-run.

We are Neutral rated. Sandoz is one of the largest generics companies in the world, with a c.USD10b 
top line. The company has a goal of adding USD3b of sales by FY28. We think this is achievable, but 
see a more meaningful opportunity in the biosimilars (28% of sales)  compared with generics (72% of 
sales). We  forecast 3.0% FY24-28E sales CAGR for generics / 9.4% for biosimilars. 

We use the UBS Evidence Lab Formulary and Pricing data for the US market, as well as IQVIA data to 
monitor competitive dynamics. For biosimilars, we have evaluated the opportunity for Sandoz by 
utilising our PharmaValues database to assess the value of products going off-patent to the end of 
the decade, with our pricing and market share assumptions to Sandoz informing our biosimilar sales 
forecasts. 700 bps of top-line mix swing towards biosimilars (UBSe) through FY28E drives c.130bps of 
gross margin expansion FY23-28E on our forecasts, based on what we know of comparable biologic 
drugs.

The shares are currently pricing in 1.9% terminal growth from 2032, which we think fairly values the 
growth opportunities into the next decade from an acceleration in biologic patent expiries and GLP-
1s.

Sandoz AG UBS Research

First thoughts on streamlined regulatory framework for biosimilars
Sandoz specifically called out developments at the FDA and EMA that could lead to 
streamlined biosimilar studies in the future that don't require comparative efficacy and/
or pharmacodynamic studies. Sandoz has already taken steps to streamline its 
pembrolizumab (bKeytruda) phase 3 study based on these developments. Whilst these 
steps could reduce the cost of biosimilar development in the future, this reduction in 
barriers to entry could increase competition for Sandoz, with greater focus on 
commercial and manufacturing execution.

Changes to forecasts
� We cut our underlying biosimilar forecasts. 1Q sales suggests  a material headwind 

to US adalimumab pricing. If Sandoz are price takers so such private label contracts 
given they provide high volumes in the US market, it could erode biosimilar 
margins.

� The ustekinumab private label arrangement means that Sandoz will book an 
effective royalty income in other revenues rather than product sales, which we 
update for in our model.

� We update for the latest spot FX rates, which has a material benefit to Sandoz 
sales, moving from a 4% headwind to a 1.7% tailwind to sales. On earnings, this is 
an average 11% benefit to 2025-29E EPS.

Management commentary & call feedback
� Biosimilars – benefit of regulatory streamlining. Regulators moving to more 

streamlined studies. Blanket wide decision by regulators on streamlining. 

� Remain in leading position for adalimumab. Saw erosion in private label pricing, 
which should be expected at this stage

� Tyruko – reaching 21% market share in Europe. In the US working with partner 
and FDA – remain confident in launch before year end

� Amongst first companies to launch all reference strengths for Pyzchiva. Biosimilar 
penetration in Europe up to 30%, which is ahead of relative adalimumab 
penetration. 39% share for Sandoz

� US tariffs – Sandoz is significantly insulated from US tariffs. Tariffs would result in 
price rises and disruption to supply. Manufacturing footprint predominantly in 
Europe. Can absorb impact of confirmed tariffs in guidance.

Q&A

Q: What should we expect for the private label Ustekinumab launch?

A: Structured the deal slightly differently, so only would book income. 9M before we see 
an inflection in Ustekinumab.

Q: Factors that contributed to such a material slow down in biosimilar growth?

A: Had to renegotiate with CVS for the contract. Had a strong final quarter last year. 
Some customers take big orders last year.

Cimerli impact was almost no sales in 1Q.

Q: Limited penetration in biosimilar Stelara market, how will this evolve?

A: Won’t see this in the IQVIA data. 6-9 month before we see a big inflection as 
contracts need to be negotiated.

Q: Keytruda trial – does this reduce barriers to entry?

A: EMA and FDA are becoming more aligned. Step in the right direction. Will the 
biologics market commoditise – still a very high level of investment. Indian generics 
companies still haven’t come in Europe. Going from clinical to commercial is also very 
tough and we have seen biosimilar players struggle. Want to continue to reinvest and 
see this as an exciting development for the sector.

Q: Tyruko; quick update on JCV assay?

A: Working with the regulator. Anticipating a launch in 4Q this year.

Q: GLP-1s expectation?

A: partnered for the Canadian market and similarly for Brazil and Mexico. Never seen a 
product with such high demand. Canada is the second largest sema market in the world 
and we are already well positioned. Is a long journey, starting with Canada next year.

Q: Could biosimilars be excluded from tariffs?

A: Without our industry there is no healthcare in the US given 90% volume is generics 
and biosims. Looking at PBM reform and channel reform could have more benefit. 
Optimistic we could see no tariffs in this space.

Q: Pembro development. N=720 patient study ongoing, how enrolled is that study?



Sandoz AG 1 May 2025 ab 7

A: Looking at how we minimize the study from here. Will keep current patients on the 
study.

Q: Hyrimoz in the US tracking vs expectations?

A: In terms of volume, it is in-line with our expectations. Still one of the biggest 
opportunities for us in the US.

Q: Strongest balance sheet in the sector – what is your appetite for M&A?

A: Well positioned on currency too. Small M&A we would consider. Still untangling from 
Novartis. BD&L more likely as seen strong return there.

Q: Tariffs – if on all your products, what would be the impact?

A: Think we can still handle further tariffs in the guidance. Only a small % impact. <20% 
of sales in the US. Well positioned vs competition to weather this and absorb this.

Q: Can humira still be a growth driver in the US?

A: 20% of the market has converted and we have most of that. Still 80% to go. Still 
probably the biggest single product driver in the US.

Q: When is the earliest that you can launch Yervoy?

A: Toward the late 20s, early 30s. Confident that we will be there on market formation 
with this product.

Q: Cimerli – can you help us on how much effect this has moving forward?

A: Don’t expect any Cimerli sales in 2025. Would reintroduce in 2026 and a modest sales 
build from there.

Q: R&D costs with the streamlined biosimilar trials?

A: Will be happy when we have 50-60 products in the pipeline from 29 today. An 
exciting development for the space.

Q: Big three PBMs – how are they moving their formularies and if prioritising own label 
do you need to sign more agreements?

A: Not all PBMs are the same. Only really one PBM has changed coverage with own label 
deals. We don’t see the private label model as sustainable and only specific to pharmacy 
benefit.

Q: Broader tariff impact? If you could manage the guide this year is that due to inventory 
moves? What would be an annualised impact?

A: On an annualised basis we would look at 60-65m before any pricing actions if we 
applied a 20% tariff across China and Europe. 

Q: Capacity expansion plans for GLP-1?

A: The capacity that we are using for Canada is with third parties. Seeing this as a bit of 
an experiment. Don’t know where price will go. 

Q: Denosumab – approvals from competitors. How do you expect this market to 
develop?



Sandoz AG 1 May 2025 ab 8

A: We are the only company with a Q code at launch which gives us a big advantage to 
sign contracts early. Excited about it. Got about 30% of the market in Canada and 
looking forward to a launch in EU too.

Source: UBS estimates

UPSIDE (CHF53.30): In our upside scenario, both the biosimilars and generics businesses 
do better than we anticipate in our base case. In particular, biosimilar growth in the low 
double digits is sustained FY24-28E. As a consequence, core EBITDA margin also rises to 
the top end of the guided 24-26% range in FY28E.

BASE (CHF37.00): Our base case sees 3.0% sales growth for generics FY24-28E, with 
9.4% for biosimilars over the same time horizon. Growth in biosimilars drives core 
EBITDA margin to the bottom end of 2028E EBITDA margin guidance.

DOWNSIDE (CHF29.00): Our downside scenario sees stagnation in the generics 
business, below our expectations, and the biosimilars grow below our base case. Core 
EBITDA margins end up below the lower end of the FY28 guided range.

Company Description

Sandoz is a Swiss producer of generic and biosimilar medicines, operating in over 100 
markets in North America, Europe and other international territories.

Valuation Method and Risk Statement

We value Sandoz shares on an EV/EBITDA basis. The main risks to our Sandoz thesis include: 
(1) worse pipeline success than we model, in particular for key biosimilar projects, (2) more 
aggressive competition than we account for, (3) failure of the US generics business to stabilise 
after underperformance in recent years. Risks for the pharmaceutical industry in general 
include political risks, government oversight of the approval and ongoing manufacturing 
process, discovery bottleneck and pipeline attrition, competitive development, patent 
challenges (both for originators and for those who want to copy drugs) and product liability.

KEY DEFINITIONS: Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over 
the next 12 months. In some cases, this yield may be based on accrued dividends. Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as 
the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a forecast of, the equity risk premium). Under Review (UR) 
Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are subject to possible change in the 
near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. Short-Term Ratings reflect the expected 
near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months.

EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES: UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors 
such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Sell: Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. Core 
Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review Consultation (IRC). 
Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's debt. As a result, stocks 
deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rating. When such exceptions apply, 
they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.

any claims, comparisons, recommendations, statistics or other technical data will be supplied upon request. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of 
future results. Transaction costs may be significant in option strategies calling for multiple purchases and sales of options, such as spreads and straddles. Because

affect the outcome of contemplated options transactions.
Mortgage and asset-backed securities may involve a high degree of risk and may be highly volatile in response to fluctuations in interest rates or other market 
conditions. Foreign currency rates of exchange may adversely affect the value, price or income of any security or related instrument referred to in the document.

Investing in structured investments involves significant risks. For a detailed discussion of the risks involved in investing in any particular structured investment, you must read 
the relevant offering materials for that investment. Structured investments are unsecured obligations of a particular issuer with returns linked to the performance of an 
underlying asset. Depending on the terms of the investment, investors could lose all or a substantial portion of their investment based on the performance of the underlying 
asset. Investors could also lose their entire investment if the issuer becomes insolvent. UBS does not guarantee in any way the obligations or the financial condition of any 
issuer or the accuracy of any financial information provided by any issuer. Structured investments are not traditional investments and investing in a structured investment is 
not equivalent to investing directly in the underlying asset. Structured investments may have limited or no liquidity, and investors should be prepared to hold their investment 
to maturity. The return of structured investments may be limited by a maximum gain, participation rate or other feature. Structured investments may include call features and, 
if a structured investment is called early, investors would not earn any further return and may not be able to reinvest in similar investments with similar terms. Structured 
investments include costs and fees which are generally embedded in the price of the investment. The tax treatment of a structured investment may be complex and may differ 
from a direct investment in the underlying asset. UBS and its employees do not provide tax advice. Investors should consult their own tax advisor about their own tax situation 
before investing in any securities.

Important Information About Sustainable Investing Strategies: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and incorporate environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) factors into investment process and portfolio construction. Strategies across geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. 
Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio manager’s ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise 
would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing 
considerations may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered by the portfolio manager, and the 
investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ.
