Margin Gains Continue, While Macro a Sales 
Risk

1Q results include solid margin gains; Sales guide trimmed on macro concerns
CAKE's 1Q results & call commentary highlighted resilient sales trends in a tough macro 
environment, w/ solid margin gains, while key guidance metrics for 2Q & '25 were 
below expectations largely due macro concerns. 2Q guidance  included revenue of 
$935-950MM (Cons. $954MM) and net income margin of 5.3-5.4% (Cons. 5.8%), 
which appears achievable. '25 net income margin guidance was reiterated at 4.75% 
(Cons. 4.78%), while total revenue guidance was lowered to $3.76BN at the midpoint 
of revenue range (from $3.8BN, Cons. $3.78BN). We remain focused on the 
achievability of guidance through the yr as macro headwinds persist, w/ risk of consumer 
spending pressure shifting into higher income cohorts, while tariffs could impact 
margins directly & indirectly. Despite solid execution & results in recent quarters, we 
remain cautious that industry pressures represent risks to the sales outlook and shares.

1Q sss remain stable; focus on trends through '25 & possible macro pressure risk
1Q Cheesecake brand sss of 1.0% (Cons. 1.1%) consisted of 4.0% pricing, -1.2% 
traffic and -1.8% mix. Traffic was down sequentially due to impacts from industry 
pressure and LA  fires. Mix headwind persisted, reflecting a new menu rollout featuring 
lower price point items and a shift to non-alcoholic beverage mix, with the pressure 
likely continuing through the rest of the year. Focus remains on generating traffic 
momentum and maintaining favorable brand positioning against industry peers, with 
support from marketing, loyalty contribution, menu innovation, and an improved value 
proposition. We remain somewhat cautious on sales trends in '25 given risk from 
incremental macro pressures, w/ potential tariff impacts on consumer spending. We 
model 1.0% '25 sss (4.0% pricing, -1.8% mix, -1.2% traffic).

Margin expansion progress encouraging, but risk exists from macro weakness
1Q restaurant margins (RLM) of 15.9% (up 90 bps y/y) were better than Consensus' 
15.4%, driven largely by favorable COGS. Pricing of 4% in 1Q more than offset ~flat 
commodity inflation, w/ similar pricing levels expected for FY25, driving a targeted 15-
25 bps RLM improvement y/y. We model 15.7% RLM for '25, reflecting modest COGS 
& labor leverage against largely consistent inflation (LSD-MSD total inflation), assuming 
currently proposed tariff levels. Margin potential is targeted to reach up to ~17-18% 
over the next 3-4 yrs, w/ multiple opportunities to unlock gains. But we view significant 
LT gains as a show-me story for now, w/ macro & other pressures as potential risks. 

Valuation: Despite margin gains, risk to sales outlook could impact multiple

KEY DEFINITIONS: Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over 
the next 12 months. In some cases, this yield may be based on accrued dividends. Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as 
the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a forecast of, the equity risk premium). Under Review (UR) 
Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are subject to possible change in the 
near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. Short-Term Ratings reflect the expected 
near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months.

EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES: UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors 
such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Sell: Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. Core 
Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review Consultation (IRC). 
Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's debt. As a result, stocks 
deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rating. When such exceptions apply, 
they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.

For financial instruments admitted to trading on an EU regulated market: UBS AG, its affiliates or subsidiaries (excluding UBS Securities LLC) acts as a market maker or 
liquidity provider (in accordance with the interpretation of these terms in the UK) in the financial instruments of the issuer save that where the activity of liquidity provider is

For financial instruments admitted to trading on a non-EU regulated market: UBS may act as a market maker save that where this activity is carried out in the US in accordance

Investing in structured investments involves significant risks. For a detailed discussion of the risks involved in investing in any particular structured investment, you must read 
the relevant offering materials for that investment. Structured investments are unsecured obligations of a particular issuer with returns linked to the performance of an 
underlying asset. Depending on the terms of the investment, investors could lose all or a substantial portion of their investment based on the performance of the underlying 
asset. Investors could also lose their entire investment if the issuer becomes insolvent. UBS does not guarantee in any way the obligations or the financial condition of any 
issuer or the accuracy of any financial information provided by any issuer. Structured investments are not traditional investments and investing in a structured investment is 
not equivalent to investing directly in the underlying asset. Structured investments may have limited or no liquidity, and investors should be prepared to hold their investment 
to maturity. The return of structured investments may be limited by a maximum gain, participation rate or other feature. Structured investments may include call features and, 
if a structured investment is called early, investors would not earn any further return and may not be able to reinvest in similar investments with similar terms. Structured 
investments include costs and fees which are generally embedded in the price of the investment. The tax treatment of a structured investment may be complex and may differ 
from a direct investment in the underlying asset. UBS and its employees do not provide tax advice. Investors should consult their own tax advisor about their own tax situation 
before investing in any securities.

Important Information About Sustainable Investing Strategies: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and incorporate environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) factors into investment process and portfolio construction. Strategies across geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. 
Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio manager’s ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise 
would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing 
considerations may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered by the portfolio manager, and the 
investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ.

Within the past 12 months UBS Switzerland AG, its affiliates or subsidiaries may have received or provided investment services and activities or ancillary services as per MiFID 
II which may have given rise to a payment or promise of a payment in relation to these services from or to this company.
