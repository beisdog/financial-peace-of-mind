UBS Sustainable Health
Transformation Fund
26 May 2025, 13:57 UTC, written by Jon Andrea Barblan, Jonas Schneider

Our Chief Investment Office (CIO) believes that Longevity is driving changes across sectors as lifespans extend
and the elderly population grows. This shift is reshaping demand and spurring growth in new economic areas.
The health care sector, crucial for addressing the needs of an aging population, is a key focus for near-term
investment.

One of our solutions to invest in Longevity is the UBS Sustainable Health Transformation Fund. This solution offers
the following characteristics:

• Participate in the health transformation to benefit from the disruptive innovations that are transforming the
healthcare system

• Tilt to small and mid-caps: globally diversified access to highly innovative small- and mid-cap companies that are
expected to drive the transformation of the sector

• Sustainability: has a strong sustainability profile and is aligned towards SDG#3 (Good Health & Well-being)

• Simplicity: easy access to multiple healthcare-related themes from UBS CIO Global Wealth Management’s longer-term
investment ideas

• Combined core strengths: pairs UBS GWM CIO identified long-term investment themes with the portfolio
construction expertise of UBS Asset Management



For UBS Marketing purposes

Risks: The fund invests in equities and may therefore be subject to strong fluctuations in value. For this reason, an
investment horizon of at least five years is required. The fund focuses intentionally on stocks within certain themes, so
there may be additional risks. The fund pursues an active management style, which means that performance can deviate
substantially from that of its reference index. Additional information about these and other risks can be found in the
prospectus and the KID document. Past performance is no indication of future results.

The above information is for marketing purposes and should not be considered as personal investment advice.
