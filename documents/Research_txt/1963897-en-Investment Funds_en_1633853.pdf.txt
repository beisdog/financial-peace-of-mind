BlueBay Global Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Fund
20 June 2025, 08:50 UTC, written by Jon Andrea Barblan

Our Chief Investment Office (CIO) believes that within fixed income, investment grade bonds offer attractive
yields and should deliver capital appreciation if interest rate expectations decline, as our CIO expects. However,
managing the fixed income exposure is a very complex task, and we recommend delegating it to best-in-class
fixed income managers.

One of our solutions to invest in investment grade bonds is the BlueBay Global Investment Grade Corporate Bond
Fund. This solution offers the following characteristics:

• Actively managed global investment grade corporate bond fund

• BlueBay is running corporate bond funds since 2003 with an experienced and stable team

• Seeks to generate excess returns of 150bps per annum through active management

• Research capabilities held across the investment teams with 40+ analysts based in 2 locations

• Proven track record of strong IG investment performance

Risks: The fund invests in fixed income securities which poses a higher risk than cash and hence investors will move up
the risk curve and take credit, default and interest rate risks. The fund can use derivatives, which may result in additional
risks (particularly counterparty risk). This requires that investors have an appropriate risk tolerance and capacity. Additional
information about these and other risks can be found in the funds KID and prospectus. Past performance is no indication
of future results.
