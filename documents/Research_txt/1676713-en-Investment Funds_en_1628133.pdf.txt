Goldman Sachs India Equity Fund
3 June 2025, 16:48 UTC, written by Jon Andrea Barblan

Our Chief Investment Office (CIO) views India’s market as attractive. High structural rates of GDP growth are
supported by favorable demographics, and CIO expect 12% EPS growth in fiscal year 2025 (MSCI India) and
14% in fiscal year 2026.

One of our preferred solutions to invest in India equities is the Goldman Sachs India Equity Fund which offers the
following characteristics:

• The fund is unconstrained by any benchmark but with the goal to outperform the MSCI India IMI NR USD index
over a market cycle.

• It is an all-cap portfolio with stock specific risk driving returns. The fund is actively managed with a high active share
of typically more than 65%.

• Pure fundamental stock selection process. Focus on companies where the portfolio managers estimate intrinsic
value is substantially different from what the market has priced into the stock.

• The India Equity Research Team is a boutique research team within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. They are
located onshore, do their own proprietary research and leverage the extensive resources of GSAM.

Risks: The Portfolio mostly invests in emerging market shares and similar instruments which typically experience higher
levels of price fluctuations than those in developed markets. Emerging markets are likely to bear higher risk due to lower
liquidity and possible lack of adequate financial, legal, social, political and economic structures, protection and stability as
well as uncertain tax positions. Additional information about these and other risks can be found in the fund’s prospectus
and KID. Past performance is no indication of future results.
