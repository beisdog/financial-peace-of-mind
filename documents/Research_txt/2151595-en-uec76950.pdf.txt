Mercedes-Benz: ~300bps negative Cars margin impact from US tariffs in FY25; 3-
5% margin the new normal?
The key new piece of information in the earnings call was CFO Harald Wilhelm’s guide 
of a ~300bps negative impact on Cars margin for calendar year 2025 should tariffs 
remain in place; this is before potential price mitigating action, but includes tactical 
mitigation like inventory management. We recently cut our forecasts to reflect the tariff 
impact; we had taken down Cars EBIT margin by ~200bps to 4.4% including some price 
mitigation. As the annualised impact excluding the tactical inventory management 
seems to be at least 400bps (before pricing), the question is whether 2026 could be even 
weaker than 2025. CEO Ola Källenius highlighted that any potential onshoring 
investments (be it in vehicle or powertrain assembly) would take several years to 
execute. On the positive side, management flagged solid European demand; and in-line 
performance in China (albeit with risks to imported GLE/GLS where buffer stock only 
lasts for ~1 quarter) and strong cost cutting performance. The capital allocation policy 
was also confirmed but the CFO cautioned that actual share buyback activity will be 
aligned with (potentially lower) FCF.

Our view:
We see no need to change our recently revised estimates. We think the buy side has 
already discounted a Cars EBIT margin in the 4-6% range (vs. 6-8% prior) even though a 
3-5% range also seems possible based on the ~300bps tariff impact guide. We are at a 
4.4% Cars margin for 2025E and 5.2% in 2026E; next year’s number might be too high 
if we see only little pricing action on the US imported vehicles from Europe (S-Class and 
G, in particular). It seems German OEM management teams (not just MBG) remain 
somewhat optimistic that the tariff burden could be lower in the end as there is hope 
that the US administration would offer some relief in case of additional investment 
commitments in the US. There is little visibility on such a scenario materialising at this 
point. We remain Neutral on MBG: we think an attractive capital allocation policy, 
including upcoming SBB activity after the AGM, should be supportive to the share price, 
aligned with FCF generation (a potential DTG stake sale remains part of the plan as 
confirmed by the CEO in the call).

Earnings/Share price impact:
Negative.

Stellantis: Not much additional colour on tariff impact in the 
earnings call

After withdrawing FY25 guidance due to US auto tariffs, CFO Doug Ostermann 
refrained from giving  more detail about the potential US tariff impact. He highlighted 
that Stellantis’ first priority is working with suppliers to increase US content (he said 80% 
of supplier content in US made vehicles is currently USMCA compliant), and Stellantis is 
also exploring  boosting US output for models with dual production locations (the CFO 
mentioned trucks capacity in Michigan as example). No further commentary about US 
pricing plans and AOI/FCF impact. Commentary on Europe was generally constructive 
(good order situation for new B-Segment models, relatively stable pricing trend thanks 
to more flexible CO2 rules).

Our view: We recently downgraded Stellantis to Neutral because US tariffs have put the 
NA turnaround plan at risk. Should the tariff picture remain unchanged vs. today, we 
think group AOI may be just slightly above break-even and FCF clearly in negative 
territory. While Stellantis has the lowest utilisation in the US among the Detroit-3, just 
around 50%, tooling would likely be required to localise more production of the 
profitable Mexico-made trucks, and we think this would take several quarters to 
execute. We had cut 2025E AOI to €3.9bn for the group (2.5% margin), with NA in loss-
making territory (-€1.8bn AOI). Our FCF forecast for 2025 of €-2.5bn could still turn out 
to be on the optimistic side, depending on working capital dynamics in NA. At this point, 
we lack confidence  the Detroit-3 will partially offset the tariff burden for imported 
vehicles via price increases; especially Stellantis is very focused on regaining market 
share. While the latest tariff developments (deductibility of parts) are good news for the 
Detroit-3, we had already assumed this in our new base case, i.e. we see no reason to 
raise our estimates. The positive European order trend for passenger cars is reassuring 
(and seems an industry-wide theme), but we think share price performance will 
predominantly be driven by the trend in the US. We stay Neutral with unchanged 
estimates & €8.8/share PT. At PT, STLA would trade on 6.2x P/E (IFRS 2026E). Visibility on 
dividends is low and SBB will likely remain shelved for the foreseeable future.

Volkswagen: No US tariff guide in the call; Europe for once 
the source of strength

Three key (non-) messages from CFO Arno Antlitz in yesterday’s earnings call: (1) No 
quantification whatsoever about US tariff impact, but VW signals willingness to invest 
more in the US; (2) European demand is strong for BEV and ICE, the order book stretches 
well into Q3 with a further increase m/m in April; pricing is also seen as healthy and 
stable; (3) China holds up better than expected; VW chose not to chase volume this year 
ahead of the busy launch year 2026 and instead focuses on pricing discipline.

Our view: VW’s “bottom end of range” guidance confirmation pre-tariffs for OP 
margin (5.5-6.5%) and FCF (€2-5bn) still bears downside risk as the US tariff impact gets 
factored in – we think a new OP margin corridor of 4-5% is the most likely scenario if the 
status quo on tariffs doesn’t change. We update our financial model for three items, 
resulting in a marginally higher OP estimate of €14.5bn (+2% vs. prior) for 2025E and 
€15.7bn (+1% vs. prior) for 2026E: (1) Porsche’s profit warning, which was 
predominantly non-tariff related; (2) a better earnings outlook for Brand Group Core in 
Europe thanks to solid demand and a stronger order book; (3) a slightly less steep decline 
in China earnings this year. Regarding investments, VW might increase spending in NA 
but this would probably spread over several years and as pointed out by the CFO, there 
should be some scope for savings elsewhere. For example, we think Scout investments 
could be partially repurposed for Audi/Porsche SUVs. We stay Neutral, but believe  the 
market is likely looking at VW with a more constructive bias vs. the other German OEMs 
near-term due to its Europe-centricity.

Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG: "OP margin to linger in mass 
market territory for a while" 

    
Unless US tariffs disappear, OP margins likely to remain well below 10% 

Factoring in permanent US auto tariffs implies another ~20% downside to P911’s 
sharply revised 2025 guidance; and even after stripping out 2025 charges with one-off 
character, we think the perspective for a better year 2026 is uncertain. We think Porsche 
is likely to remain in mass-market OEM territory from an OP margin perspective for the 
foreseeable future, and believe this bears risk of further de-rating of shares. The 
“luxury” PE of ~19x on 2026E, clean of one-offs, is only justifiable if Porsche delivers 
progress on: (1) right-sizing its structure; (2) a swift rebuild of the executive board 
(announced, but no timeline provided by the company); and (3) attractive new ICE/
hybrid products supporting the mix. While we have some confidence Porsche will 
address these issues with a 12-24 month view, the near-term risk seems skewed to the 
downside. The silver lining on the horizon remains that Porsche, as a luxury car brand, 
should be able to generate double-digit margins but this will take time and depend on 
execution of the (new) team for a smaller, better Porsche. The CMD on 17 September 
might shed more light on this.

Another round of steep earnings cuts by ~15% underlying 

We recently cut our earnings forecasts across the board to factor in US tariffs, and revise 
down again for the ~€0.5bn Cellforce write-down (one-off in 2025) and the ~€0.7bn 
OP impact of even lower China volumes and related supplier compensation (likely not a 
one-off). We remain uncertain as to why Porsche decided to include the US tariff impact 
for April and May only, but we estimate extrapolating the impact for the remainder of 
2025 implies another €1.0-1.1bn downside to its guidance (gross). We see potential for 
high-single digit % price hikes for the 911 range but not for SUVs, suggesting further 
downside risk to the new 2025 OP guide of at least €0.5bn. For 2026, the one-offs 
should reverse (UBSe: ~€1.0bn y/y in total) but the US tariff needs to be factored in for 
the full year instead of 3Qs in 2025. We forecast €2.3bn OP in 2025E (6.2% OPM) and 
€3.1bn in 2026E (8.0% OPM). Some positive price/mix effects of the new 911 Turbo are 
included for 2026 in the OP bridge, but the risk is that China continues to weaken.

Valuation: New €41 PT (from €45), Neutral with near-term caution 

Our lower EPS & FCF estimates drive a cut in our DCF-based price target to €41/share 
(from €45/share).

Tesla, Inc.: "5 quick thoughts on report TSLA opening CEO 
search" 

    
We wanted to provide quick initial thoughts on the WSJ report that that Tesla’s 
Board of Directors last month opened a search for a CEO to succeed Elon Musk. 
It is unclear if the search is ongoing. 

1. If the report is true, and if Tesla were to install a new CEO, it would be a watershed 
moment for the company. There is no denying Musk’s vision, leadership and 
contribution to the automotive industry.

2. That said, perhaps no other company has as large a key man risk as TSLA. This 
report may re-highlight that risk. Even if Musk stays on as CEO, we do believe it will 
eventually prove important for investors to have a better sense of succession 
planning at the company.

3. Musk recently stated on the 1Q25 earning call that he’ll “be allocating far more of 
my time to Tesla.” The report indicates that the Board asked Musk to spend more 
time on Tesla. So, it’s possible that this action assuages Board concerns. 

4. Even if Musk were no longer CEO, there is a path for him to remain heavily 
involved with the company and help guide strategy and vision. However, that 
could create tension between him and the theoretical new CEO. Further, Musk 
owns ~13% of TSLA shares, though he has publicly stated he wants ~25% voting 
control to feel comfortable in helping to grow Tesla to be a leader in AI and 
robotics.

5. Tesla as a company and stock is at a somewhat of a critical juncture. The core 
business (and actual financials of the company) is primarily auto which has been 
under greater sales and profit pressure. But the Tesla bull case narrative is that Tesla 
is an AI company, with Musk himself indicating in various ways that the value of 
Tesla is tied to autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. Finding a CEO who can 
captivate the market and investors as much as Musk is a tall task, in our view. We'll 
end with this portion highlighted from the article: “Last spring, he told that person 
that he no longer wanted to be CEO of Tesla, but that he was worried that no one 
could replace him atop the company and sell the vision that Tesla isn’t just an 
automaker, but the future of robotics and automation as well. “

We will continue to monitor developments and provide updated thoughts.

Q: How did the results compare vs expectations? 

A: €35.8bn revenues (-14% y/y) in line with consensus. Bridge: Volume/mix -9.6% y/y, 
net price -3.4% y/y, FX ~flat y/y.

Q: What were the most noteworthy areas in the results? 

A: NA revenues down -25% y/y vs. volumes -20%, i.e. -5% attributable to price/mix/FX. 
EE shows -3% revenues and -8% shipments (positive mix effect). STLA highlights 
+190bps market share gain in EU30 q/q. Total inventory 1.21m, slightly up but down at 
dealer level q/q.

Q: Has the company's outlook/guidance changed?

Dana Inc.: "Beat, reiterate and sales process underway" 

    
Net: We expect a positive reaction to DAN shares this AM. 1) ~3% 1Q25 EBITDA beat, 
2) Reiterated 2025 EBITDA guidance and midpoint is ~10% above consensus – tariffs 
are manageable. 3) Accelerating $300mm cost savings plan with 2025 cost savings now 
$225mm from $175mm prior. 4) Sale of Off-Highway business is underway with a 
competitive process. Call is at 9am. (888) 440-5873. Conference ID: 9943139.

1Q25 EBITDA beat. Revenue of $2.4bn (-14% y/y) was inline with our estimate and 
consensus. Vol/mix reduced sales by -$347mm y/y driven by lower volumes across all end 
markets, currency an additional -$53mm headwind and commodities being an $10mm 
headwind. This was slightly offset by performance which was a $27mm tailwind, 
EBITDA-Adj was $188mm (-15.7% y/y, 8% margin), above the Street at $182mm. FCF 
was a (seasonal) use of $101mm, but $67mm improved y/y. EPS less important for DAN, 
but was $0.13, above the $0.08/$0.12 estimates from UBS/consensus. See Figure 1 for 
more details.

Guidance reiterated: Sales still $9.5-$10bn but trending towards upper-end with tariff 
recoveries helping (no EBITDA impact). Adjusted EBITDA still ~$975mm with cost 
savings offsetting softer market and tariff, FCF still ~$225mm, EPS (less important for 
DAN) now $1.40 from $1.65 on tax impact of regional profit mix.

Other points: 

� Efforts to improve FCF/cash by exploring 2025 capex reduction and identified non-
core assets to monetize – expect pre-tax proceeds of $50mm in 2Q25.

� Market outlook assumes NA CV demand softens, but offset by strength in SA and 
EU; OH seeing some 2Q25 pre-buy; LV production schedules stable be see demand 
risk later in year.

Japan Autos, Auto Parts and Auto-tech Sector: "Parts tariffs 
to be limited in FY3/26" 

    
Refunds for a limited time only, but positive for short-term profit 

A partial refund of US auto parts tariffs for a limited period of two years has been 
announced. The UBS Japan auto team has factored vehicle and parts tariffs of 25% into 
its forecasts, so this announcement provides potential upside to FY3/26-FY3/27 profits. 
Since various measures to address tariff impact are expected to be announced by the 
auto sector, and because US tariff-related news is likely to have both positive and 
negative effects on their share prices, our investment stance on Japan's auto sector is 
neutral. Our top pick stock is Toyota Motor. We also rate Suzuki and Denso Buy. 

No tariffs on USMCA parts for the time being 

For import tariffs on parts, a certain percentage of each company's average retail price is 
now due to be refunded. The maximum refund will be 3.75% of the vehicle price from 3 
April 2025 through 30 April 2026 (tariffs: 15% of the vehicle price, 15% x 25% = 
3.75%), and 2.5% from 1 May 2026 through 30 April 2027 (tariffs: 10% of the vehicle 
price, 10% x 25% = 2.5%). Additionally, auto parts that are compliant with the US-
Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will be exempt from tariffs from April 2025 
through April 2027. We estimate that the USMCA parts procurement rate for Japanese 
OEMs that produce vehicles in the US exceeds 60%, and it is now likely that there will be 
no or only limited tariffs on their parts in FY3/26. The purpose of the tariff refund is to 
provide a grace period for firms to transfer production to the US (link, Japanese only) 
and it is uncertain whether the 0% tariff rate on USMCA parts will continue after May 
2027. 

Suppliers are steadily passing tariff costs onto their prices 

At the company's January-March results briefing, Valeo's CFO commented that '75% 
compensation has already been secured' against US tariffs. It appears that most of the 
suppliers' tariff costs will be passed on to the auto OEMs. We expect100% of the tariff 
costs to be passed on to the Japanese OEMs and 70% to others.

Pole Position 1 May 2025 ab 9

Sector view
With looming US auto tariff and likely slowing global growth on unpredictability of US 
trade policies, we expect 2025 global auto production to decline by -1.5% y/y, noting 
that the range of potential outcomes is wide, even more so for 2026. We model NA to 
be hit the hardest at -8% y/y, but also other regions will be affected by lower exports and 
a softer GDP outlook.
As we included US tariffs impact, our recent 2025E EPS cuts ranged from ~20-30% for 
most OEMs and parts suppliers whereas tires show relative resilience; cuts for 2026E are 
in the same order of magnitude. Unless the auto specific tariffs get reduced or removed, 
a scenario with low probability in our view, we believe the sector is highly unlikely to 
outperform the broader market.

OEMs: Despite a significant tariff impact on earnings, we continue to prefer BMW on its 
high degree of localization, cash generation & returns and Neue Klasse. Renault stands 
out as European-centric OEM with very minor tariff risk, but it already is a consensual 
relative long.

Suppliers: For tier-1 suppliers, we tend to take a cautious stance overall and prefer the 
quality names like Autoliv. Companies with elevated financial leverage (Forvia, Valeo, 
Schaeffler) could in a recession scenario become vulnerable.

Tires: (Continental, Michelin, Pirelli) is a segment driven by aftermarket and therefore 
has the lowest downside risk to earnings, in our view. We still see Conti's likely value-
crystallizing autos spin-off on track.

Valuation Method and Risk Statement

The automobile sector has in the past exhibited high levels of volatility in terms of profitability 
and valuation. Sector earnings and performance are highly sensitive to variations in volume, 
pricing, raw material costs and currency, all of which have been volatile recently. Long term 
structural trends continue to improve as a result of higher demand in EM, early signs of sector 
concentration improving and structurally lower currency exposure but near term cyclical 
drivers have become more challenging after several years of strong earnings and share price 
performance. We are also concerned that in a macro recovery rising interest rates would 
become a material headwind for the industry.

KEY DEFINITIONS: Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over 
the next 12 months. In some cases, this yield may be based on accrued dividends. Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as 
the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a forecast of, the equity risk premium). Under Review (UR) 
Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are subject to possible change in the 
near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. Short-Term Ratings reflect the expected 
near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months.

EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES: UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors 
such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Sell: Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. Core 
Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review Consultation (IRC). 
Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's debt. As a result, stocks 
deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rating. When such exceptions apply, 
they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.

Investing in structured investments involves significant risks. For a detailed discussion of the risks involved in investing in any particular structured investment, you must read 
the relevant offering materials for that investment. Structured investments are unsecured obligations of a particular issuer with returns linked to the performance of an 
underlying asset. Depending on the terms of the investment, investors could lose all or a substantial portion of their investment based on the performance of the underlying 
asset. Investors could also lose their entire investment if the issuer becomes insolvent. UBS does not guarantee in any way the obligations or the financial condition of any 
issuer or the accuracy of any financial information provided by any issuer. Structured investments are not traditional investments and investing in a structured investment is 
not equivalent to investing directly in the underlying asset. Structured investments may have limited or no liquidity, and investors should be prepared to hold their investment 
to maturity. The return of structured investments may be limited by a maximum gain, participation rate or other feature. Structured investments may include call features and, 
if a structured investment is called early, investors would not earn any further return and may not be able to reinvest in similar investments with similar terms. Structured 
investments include costs and fees which are generally embedded in the price of the investment. The tax treatment of a structured investment may be complex and may differ 
from a direct investment in the underlying asset. UBS and its employees do not provide tax advice. Investors should consult their own tax advisor about their own tax situation 
before investing in any securities.

Important Information About Sustainable Investing Strategies: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and incorporate environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) factors into investment process and portfolio construction. Strategies across geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. 
Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio manager’s ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise 
would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing 
considerations may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered by the portfolio manager, and the 
investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ.

Within the past 12 months UBS Switzerland AG, its affiliates or subsidiaries may have received or provided investment services and activities or ancillary services as per MiFID 
II which may have given rise to a payment or promise of a payment in relation to these services from or to this company.
