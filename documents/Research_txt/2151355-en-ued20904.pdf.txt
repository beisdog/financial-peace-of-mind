Can It Reap-eat This Performance?

Another strong quarter amid high expectations
We think Sprouts helped to demonstrate the durability of its model. Still, we believe its 
beat and raise may not have been enough to exceed high buy side expectations. Its 
11.7% SSS compared favorably to the co's 10-11% guidance & the 11.2% consensus. 
That said, it was slightly below our 12.0% estimate and the 12-14% buy side bar (per 
our conversations with investors), helping to illustrate just how high expectations have 
become for the natural and organic grocer. Its SSS included a ~50 bp lift from KR's strike 
in Colorado as well as a harsher cold and flu season. Its SSS were pretty consistent 
throughout the quarter, but peaked in February given timing of the aforementioned 
tailwinds. Further, its gross margin expansion of 130 bps meaningfully beat sell side 
expectations (cons. 70 bps), but our conversations with investors suggest the buy side 
was expecting a sizeable beat on this line item (its now topped 100 bps of gross margin 
expansion for 3 consecutive quarters). All in, this helped to drive $1.81 in EPS (vs. UBSe 
of $1.60, cons. $1.55).

� Its 11.7% SSS equated to a 90 bp sequential acceleration on a 2 year stack. Its 
comp strength was again quite balanced, with strong performance across 
categories, channels, and geographies. Further, it continues to see new stores 
entering the comp base at strong rates.

� SFM's eCommerce business grew by 28% YoY, suggesting it contributed ~390 bps 
to SFM's total sales growth for the quarter. It's seeing strong growth across its 3 
platforms (Instacart, DoorDash, and Uber Eats), though Instacart remains the 
largest player for it by a good margin. SFM continues to benefit from its 
differentiated assortment, though it did acknowledge that it's seeing a bit of a lift 
from Instacart's decision to lower its minimum delivery threshold for Instacart+ 
members to $10 (which it did ahead of Thanksgiving).

� The grocer's SSS outpaced the Census Bureau's Grocery Store category by ~840 
bps, which was a slight slowdown from last quarter's ~870 bps. Notably, SFM has 
outpaced the Census category's pace of growth for eight consecutive quarters 
now, highlighting the relevance of its assortment.

� Sprouts private label penetration continues to tick up, reaching 24% in 1Q'25. 
This compares to 23% in 4Q'24. We believe SFM has room to continue to boost its 
private label penetration as it continues to grow its brand equity.

Turning to the balance of the year, we expect for SFM's attribute-driven assortment, 
merchandising strength, and organic produce business to help support outsized traffic 
growth relative to the industry. That said, we believe increasingly difficult SSS compares

Sprouts Farmers Market Inc 1 May 2025 ab 2

and consumer confidence risks are likely to temper earnings growth expectations a bit 
from recently elevated levels. We think its valuation is balanced at current levels.

Could higher build costs impact long term store growth?
SFM's assortment is pretty well positioned in the event of sustained tariffs, with produce 
imports from Mexico now likely to be largely exempt due to USMCA. That said, we do 
see some risk on store growth over the long run, particularly if returns on new stores 
begin to moderate back towards historical levels and elevated tariffs are sustained 
(impacting building material costs). While this challenge likely wouldn't be unique to 
SFM, it could face a bit more impact on this  front given the importance of unit growth in 
its earnings algorithm (especially relative to other grocers).

SFM's adj. OM climbed by 225 bps YoY in 1Q, backed by gross margin strength
The grocer's adj. operating margin topped 10% in 1Q, which is the first time we've seen 
it cross that threshold as far back as we have data (quarterlies back to FY'13). While this 
pace will likely be hard to sustain at a more normalized comp pace, we think it does 
reflect the co's effective pricing structure & improving efficiency.

� The grocer's 39.6% gross margin beat our 39.0% estimate (& the 38.9% cons). Its 
130 bps of expansion was driven by the co. leveraging its improvements in 
inventory and category management. Its margin also benefitted from shrink 
leverage, though this was due in part to supply chain constraints. We're not 
expecting this latter tailwind to hold going forward as SFM improves its in stock 
levels.

� Its SG&A leveraged by ~80 bps to 27.9%. This was slightly higher than our 
estimate of 27.8% and in-line with consensus. SFM benefitted from leveraging 
labor and occupancy costs off of elevated sales. 

SFM boosted its FY'25 guidance alongside its results
The company brought up its EPS guidance range to $4.94-$5.10 from $4.52-$4.68 prior 
(UBSe $4.44, cons. $4.64). While this will likely be one of the bigger beats and raises in 
the space this quarter, our discussions with investors suggest that the buy side was 
already above $5.00 heading into earnings. We now model $5.05 for the year ahead.

� For 2Q, SFM  is anticipating 6.5%-8.5% SSS as it starts cycling tougher 
comparisons. We model at the top of the range, with a 8.5% comp, as the co. 
noted 2Q thus far is looking similar to 1Q. Guidance calls for EPS of $1.19-$1.23 in 
2Q (UBSe $1.21). 

� The grocer's 5.5%-7.5%  FY'25 SSS outlook was stepped up from its prior 4.5%-
6.5% guidance. It  suggests a ~210 bp acceleration on a 2 year stack and a 180 bp 
improvement on a 3 year basis, at the midpoint. We're modeling at the higher end 
of its expectations (UBSe 7.3%). 

� The co's full year guidance implies ~90 bps of operating margin leverage to 
7.5% at its midpoint. This would translate to its highest full year rate dating back 
to at least FY'08 (as far back as we have data).

Valuation: SFM's risk/reward looks balanced at current level
Our $196 price target ($195 prior) is based on ~36x our new CY'26 estimate (was ~38x 
our prior CY'26 estimate). Our slightly lower multiple reflects a tougher environment for 
consistent beats and raises going forward, but underlying confidence in the co's ability 
to take further market share.

KEY DEFINITIONS: Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over 
the next 12 months. In some cases, this yield may be based on accrued dividends. Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as 
the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a forecast of, the equity risk premium). Under Review (UR) 
Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are subject to possible change in the 
near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. Short-Term Ratings reflect the expected 
near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months.

EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES: UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors 
such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Sell: Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. Core 
Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review Consultation (IRC). 
Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's debt. As a result, stocks 
deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rating. When such exceptions apply, 
they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.

affect the outcome of contemplated options transactions.

Investing in structured investments involves significant risks. For a detailed discussion of the risks involved in investing in any particular structured investment, you must read 
the relevant offering materials for that investment. Structured investments are unsecured obligations of a particular issuer with returns linked to the performance of an 
underlying asset. Depending on the terms of the investment, investors could lose all or a substantial portion of their investment based on the performance of the underlying 
asset. Investors could also lose their entire investment if the issuer becomes insolvent. UBS does not guarantee in any way the obligations or the financial condition of any 
issuer or the accuracy of any financial information provided by any issuer. Structured investments are not traditional investments and investing in a structured investment is 
not equivalent to investing directly in the underlying asset. Structured investments may have limited or no liquidity, and investors should be prepared to hold their investment 
to maturity. The return of structured investments may be limited by a maximum gain, participation rate or other feature. Structured investments may include call features and, 
if a structured investment is called early, investors would not earn any further return and may not be able to reinvest in similar investments with similar terms. Structured 
investments include costs and fees which are generally embedded in the price of the investment. The tax treatment of a structured investment may be complex and may differ 
from a direct investment in the underlying asset. UBS and its employees do not provide tax advice. Investors should consult their own tax advisor about their own tax situation 
before investing in any securities.

Important Information About Sustainable Investing Strategies: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and incorporate environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) factors into investment process and portfolio construction. Strategies across geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. 
Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio manager’s ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise 
would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing 
considerations may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered by the portfolio manager, and the 
investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ.

Within the past 12 months UBS Switzerland AG, its affiliates or subsidiaries may have received or provided investment services and activities or ancillary services as per MiFID 
II which may have given rise to a payment or promise of a payment in relation to these services from or to this company.
