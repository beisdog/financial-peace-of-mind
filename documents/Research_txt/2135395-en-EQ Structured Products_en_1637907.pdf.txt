Dolphin CPN on "US Sell-Off
Opportunities" Basket
13 May 2025, 07:59 am CEST, written by Cornelius Breuninger

US equities have been under pressure since investors started to worry about the implications of President
Trump's tariff policies and the uncertainty which came along. After the strong rebound in stocks over the last
month, the UBS Chief Investment Office (CIO) downgraded US equities from Attractive to Neutral. To state the
obvious, the macro environment is uncertain. Nevertheless, the selling in markets has been vicious, and many
companies with good longer-term prospects are now trading at more attractive valuations.

Are you considering investing in oversold US equities but feeling uneasy about ongoing market uncertainty? Don’t worry
—there are still options available that can help bring greater stability to your portfolio.

After the strong rebound in stocks over the last month, the UBS Chief Investment Office (CIO) downgraded US equities
from Attractive to Neutral. The Neutral view is not a "negative" stance, indeed CIO believes the bull market is intact and
stocks will likely rise further over the next year. But the economy will have to adjust to higher tariffs, and this could lead
to a period of weaker economic data, which could be a modest headwind for stocks.
