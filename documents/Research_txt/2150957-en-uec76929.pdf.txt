Gold stocks - What's priced in?   

After material YTD gains & outperformance what is 'priced-in' for gold miners? 
After strong gains post 'Liberation Day' the  gold price has consolidated @ ~$3,300/oz 
and gold equities have given back some of the recent gains. Gold equities (GDX Index) 
are finally  working with GDX +45% YTD, outperforming gold price by ~20%. After the 
relative outperformance what is 'priced in' for gold equities? This sounds like a simple 
question, but for the miners in our view it is not as it incorporates a view on valuation 
methodology/target multiple as well as the sensitivity of earnings to commodity prices. 
For the  gold miners we base our target prices on EV/EBITDA but show what's priced 
using both target 2026 EV/EBITDA multiples & NPV and for each stock generate 
valuation sensitivities to a range of commodity prices & EV/EBITDA  multiples. 

EV/EBITDA: Using an EV/EBITDA methodology using historical consensus multiples we 
estimate on average the NA/EMEA gold stocks under our coverage are discounting 
$2,825/oz using 5yr average and ~$2,875/oz 2yr average multiples; 13-14% discount vs 
spot (~$3,300/oz). ABX, FNV & FRES  are discounting the lowest gold prices implying 
~30%/20% discounts vs spot and AEM & HOC are discounting the highest gold prices 
but still represent a small (<5%) discount vs spot.   

NPV: Using an NPV methodology the miners are discounting an average gold price of ~
$2,700/oz (slightly lower vs  EV/EBITDA methodology). EDV & ABX are discounting the 
lowest gold prices (35%/30% discount vs spot) vs higher cost silver/gold plays FRES &  
HOC are pricing  the highest gold price, but implied prices are still close to spot. 
Streaming companies FNV/WPM discount materially higher gold prices using NPV 
methodology; but have consistently traded at significant premiums to NPV reflecting 
lower implied cost of capital due to diversification, higher/more predictable cash 
margins and growth optionality in undeveloped projects that is difficult to quantify. 

Trade wars & sustained uncertainty create perfect storm for gold & gold miners
The gold price is consolidating after hitting consecutive new high but in our view the 
macro backdrop for gold remains supportive.    After  material underperformance in recent 
years gold equities (GDX Index) are outperforming, will this continue?  We acknowledge 
the poor historical operational/cost performance of gold miners but remain bullish gold 
equities. With gold price establishing a base  >$3,000/oz we believe consensus earnings 
for the gold miners will continue to  be revised higher in the coming weeks/months;  this 
should provide positive consensus earnings  momentum for gold miners vs consensus 
multiples that are already materially below historical levels. In our view aggregate 
guidance from the miners is likely to be  more realistic & post FY results through to 2Q/3Q 
numbers has typically been a better time to own gold stocks as positive gold price 
momentum should drive earnings upgrades… before potential downside to  FY 
guidance becomes a bottom-up risk (usually with 3Q results).  

Preferred NA/EMEA gold miners - ABX,  NEM,  EDV & FNV
  In our view the role of gold/gold equities as a diversifier  in portfolios remains compelling 
and gold stocks are well positioned to continue to outperform. Material performance 
dispersion has driven wide valuation differentials in the gold miners; we see this as an 
opportunity and shift preference to some of the 'cheaper turnaround stories'. We prefer 
Barrick in NA, recently upgraded Newmont; we prefer   Endevour in Europe & also 
recently upgraded Fresnillo to Buy. We continue to like near-term growth & 
diversification in streaming, we  prefer Franco-Nevada and remain Buyers of Wheaton.

Gold mining UBS Research

What's priced in? 
This sounds like a simple question, but for the miners in our view it is not as it 
incorporates a view on valuation methodology/target multiple as well as the sensitivity 
of earnings to commodity prices. For the  gold miners we base our target prices on EV/
EBITDA but show what's priced using both target 2026 EV/EBITDA multiples & NPV and 
for each stock generate valuation sensitivities to a range of commodity prices & EV/
EBITDA  multiples.  

EV/EBITDA: To derive our EV/EBITDA-based implied prices we use  2026 EV/EBITDA 
multiples based on 2 year, 5 year and 10 year average 12m forward consensus multiples. 
Historically different stocks have traded at premiums/discounts reflecting stock specific 
factors; though we note that poor operational performance has driven multiple 
compression across the gold sector (12m forward cons EV/EBITDA for GDX derated by 
~10% over the last 5 years, Figure 24Gold price vs GDX Index EV/EBITDA); as a result we believe 2yr and 5yr average 
multiples are the best  reflection of what's priced in. 

Across our NA/EMEA gold coverage we estimate on average the stocks are discounting 
$2,825/oz using 5ys average and ~$2,875/oz 2yr average multiple; 13-14% discount vs 
spot (~$3,300/oz). ABX, FNV & FRES  are discounting the lowest gold prices implying 
~30%/~22% discounts vs spot and AEM & HOC are discounting the highest gold prices 
but still represent a small (~5%) discount vs spot.    

NPV: On an NPV basis we use a SoTP analysis using a consistent  6% WACC. We assume 
a 85x gold:silver price ratio, keep other by-products (copper/lead/zinc) FX constant and 
adjust the gold price to get to the current share price. 

Using an NPV methodology the miners are discounting an average gold price of ~
$2,700/oz (slightly lower vs  EV/EBITDA methodology). EDV & ABX are discounting the 
lowest gold prices (35%/30% discount vs spot) vs higher cost silver/gold plays FRES &  
HOC are pricing  the highest gold price, but implied prices are still close to spot. 
Streaming companies FNV/WPM discount materially higher gold prices using NPV 
methodology; but have consistently traded at significant premiums to NPV reflecting 
lower implied cost of capital due to diversification, higher/more predictable cash 
margins and growth optionality in undeveloped projects that is difficult to quantify.

NEM has underperformed the gold price & GDX ~50% over the last 5yrs resulting in 
valuation de-rating from ~8x (10yr avg) to ~6.7x (2yr avg). At spot of ~$3,300/oz gold 
NEM is trading at ~6.0x EV/EBITDA; applying a 6.7x multiple implies NEM is pricing in ~
$2,900/oz gold.

AEM has outperformed US large cap peers over the LTM driving an increasing valuation 
gap. However, AEM's 12m forward multiple is similar over 5yrs & 2yrs at ~ 8.2x (vs ABX/
NEM that have de-rated); at spot AEM is trading around 8x EV/EBITDA implying the

Operational issues and guidance downgrades have seen FRES production moderate, 
costs lift, and valuation materially de-rate from >10x average EV/EBITDA in 2015-20 to 
~5x at spot. In our view FRES valuation has bottomed out and using 2ys average multiple 
of 5.5x EV/EBITDA FRES is pricing in ~$2,850/oz gold & $33/oz silver.

Gold streamers

The gold/silver streaming/royalty companies have a different business model vs the 
miners offering lower risk exposure to gold/silver due to: (1) more diversified portfolios 
reducing exposure to single assets; (2) very low/fixed costs  or zero costs reducing/
eliminating exposure to opex/capex inflation resulting in higher EBITDA margins; (3) no 
capex & lower tax resulting in  higher cash margins. As a result the streamers trade at 
much higher valuations with WPM/FNV trading at >20x EV/EBITDA and consistent  
premiums to NPV @ spot. 

Franco-Nevada

FNV has traded ~23x EV/EBITDA over the 5yrs and ~21x over the last 2yrs, including the 
closure of Cobre Panama (CP). At spot FNV is trading on 23x 2025 EV/EBITDA 
suggesting the stock is pricing in ~$3,300/oz gold and zero for Cobre Panama (CP). 
Assuming full restart of CP we estimate FNV's spot EV/EBITDA declines to ~16x; 
suggesting the stock is pricing in <$2,200/oz. In our view the market is pricing in 
something for CP but in our view the valuation post restart implies a significant discount 
vs spot gold & WPM and positive newsflow towards a restart will act as a positive 
catalyst.    

For consistent analysis we apply a 21x EV/EBITDA multiple to 2026 EBITDA including 
50% of CP implying the stock is discounting ~$2,850/oz; if the market shifts fulling 
pricing in CP the implied price is materially lower.

KEY DEFINITIONS: Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over 
the next 12 months. In some cases, this yield may be based on accrued dividends. Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as 
the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a forecast of, the equity risk premium). Under Review (UR) 
Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are subject to possible change in the 
near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. Short-Term Ratings reflect the expected 
near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months.

EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES: UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors 
such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Sell: Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. Core 
Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review Consultation (IRC). 
Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's debt. As a result, stocks 
deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rating. When such exceptions apply, 
they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.

future results. Transaction costs may be significant in option strategies calling for multiple purchases and sales of options, such as spreads and straddles. Because 
of the importance of tax considerations to many options transactions, the investor considering options should consult with his/her tax advisor as to how taxes 
affect the outcome of contemplated options transactions.

damage arising out of the use of all or any of the Information.

The analyst(s) responsible for the preparation of this document may interact with trading desk personnel, sales personnel and other parties for the purpose of gathering,

For financial instruments admitted to trading on an EU regulated market: UBS AG, its affiliates or subsidiaries (excluding UBS Securities LLC) acts as a market maker or 
liquidity provider (in accordance with the interpretation of these terms in the UK) in the financial instruments of the issuer save that where the activity of liquidity provider is 
carried out in accordance with the definition given to it by the laws and regulations of any other EU jurisdictions, such information is separately disclosed in this document. 
For financial instruments admitted to trading on a non-EU regulated market: UBS may act as a market maker save that where this activity is carried out in the US in accordance

Investing in structured investments involves significant risks. For a detailed discussion of the risks involved in investing in any particular structured investment, you must read 
the relevant offering materials for that investment. Structured investments are unsecured obligations of a particular issuer with returns linked to the performance of an 
underlying asset. Depending on the terms of the investment, investors could lose all or a substantial portion of their investment based on the performance of the underlying 
asset. Investors could also lose their entire investment if the issuer becomes insolvent. UBS does not guarantee in any way the obligations or the financial condition of any 
issuer or the accuracy of any financial information provided by any issuer. Structured investments are not traditional investments and investing in a structured investment is 
not equivalent to investing directly in the underlying asset. Structured investments may have limited or no liquidity, and investors should be prepared to hold their investment 
to maturity. The return of structured investments may be limited by a maximum gain, participation rate or other feature. Structured investments may include call features and, 
if a structured investment is called early, investors would not earn any further return and may not be able to reinvest in similar investments with similar terms. Structured 
investments include costs and fees which are generally embedded in the price of the investment. The tax treatment of a structured investment may be complex and may differ 
from a direct investment in the underlying asset. UBS and its employees do not provide tax advice. Investors should consult their own tax advisor about their own tax situation 
before investing in any securities.

Important Information About Sustainable Investing Strategies: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and incorporate environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) factors into investment process and portfolio construction. Strategies across geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. 
Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio manager’s ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise 
would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing 
considerations may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered by the portfolio manager, and the 
investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ.

Within the past 12 months UBS Switzerland AG, its affiliates or subsidiaries may have received or provided investment services and activities or ancillary services as per MiFID 
II which may have given rise to a payment or promise of a payment in relation to these services from or to this company.
