Buy on Dips Notes on S&P 500
19 June 2025, 08:36 UTC, written by Federica Cinitiempo

Dips can happen in the market but they aren't always bad news – they’re a way to buy lower-priced
investments and for investors to grow their money if prices rebound to previous highs or more. That's the
goal of the Buy on Dips Notes.

Are you worried about market corrections? Volatility and stock market dips aren't always bad news, they offer an
opportunity to buy into the market at lower levels.

After the strong rebound in stocks over the last month, the UBS Chief Investment Office (CIO) downgraded US equities
from Attractive to Neutral. CIO year-end S&P 500 price target remains 5,800.

Check the new Buy on Dips Note on S&P 500. How does it work?
• The product initially provides 25% exposure to an equity component (the underlying) and 75% a cash component.

• Investors receive yearly interest payments of [5.15-5.65]% on the cash component in the product.

• The product switches cash into its investment if the underlying dips to pre-defined trigger levels (95%, 90%, 85%).
In this case the equity component will be increased while the cash component will be decreased (reinvestment at
trigger level) allowing investors to buy the underlying at lower levels.

• The 3-years USD product is issued by Barclays and available until 27.06.2025 (ISIN: CH1439435731 <- now tradable
in UBS Mobile & e-Banking**).

• Available also in EUR (ISIN: CH1439435756) and in CHF (ISIN: CH1439432605).

Here are the main risks:
• Investors may underperform a direct investment in the underlying basket in case of a constantly positive performance

in the underlying.

• Should the third trigger level be touched, the potential loss is similar to the loss of a direct investment in the
underlying.

• The coupon is only paid on the percentage of the investment amount not invested in the underlying basket.

• No dividends will be paid during the lifetime of the product.

• Investors are fully exposed to the default risk of the issuer. In the worst case a default of the issuer can lead to a loss
of the entire invested capital.
