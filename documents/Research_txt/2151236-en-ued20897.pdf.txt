Qualcomm Inc.
Navigating Potential Demand Destruction; 
Remain Neutral

Summary
QCOM posted results at the high-end of guidance (industrial and strong Android 
(Samsung)) and guided in-line. The company is not seeing signs that customers are 
pulling in procurement ahead of tariffs, but equally not making any forward 
accommodation for potential tariff-related demand destruction. One subtle change 
here is a downtick on FQ4 (Sept) with its commentary on QCOM share for AAPL's new 
phones this Fall suggesting FQ4 is more likely flattish versus normal seasonal of up mid 
or high single digits. Zooming out, the broader story here remains the same - whether 
the adjacencies (autos/PC/IoT/industrial) can grow fast enough to offset what is lost in 
the chip (and potentially licensing) business from AAPL and whether US/China trade tilts 
the scale in favor of peers like Mediatek in the chip business and limits its ability to 
continue signing China OEMs to licensing deals when they come up for renewal (this is 
already happening with Huawei). Net, we are still hard pressed to see how Street 
estimates are conservative  unless AAPL realizes it needs QCOM for longer than expected 
(near zero chance  in our view).  We do see QCOM as a beneficiary of AI at the edge, but 
we think this continues to drag out in terms of game changing applications that will 
drive content. Net, we raise estimates slightly for C2025/2026 on more aggressive share 
repo and lower opex, and keep our PT unchanged at $145, but  still find it hard to see 
upside to Street and maintain Neutral.   

Analysis/key highlights
� March revenue of $10.8B was near the top end of the range and ~2% above 

UBSe/Street with QCT beating (driven by Handset and IoT) a little more than 
QTL missed. Gross margin was a little light at 55% but non-GAAP EPS still came in 
at $2.85, near UBSe and towards the top of guidance. 

� Qualcomm guided to June Q revenue of $9.9-10.7B and non-GAAP EPS of $2.60-
2.80 both right in line with our and Street pre-call estimates, including normal 
handset unit seasonality. Management does not expect any material direct impact 
from tariffs, only minor demand destruction. As for September, management 
expects normal seasonality for Android, Automotive, and IoT, though a decline to 
70% share of Apple's fall iPhone releases likely drives sub-seasonal growth for the 
quarter (UBSe ~flat Q/Q for Sept Q vs.+MSD/HSD% typical seasonality).

� Regarding customer disclosures from the 10-Q, Apple revenue was down ~30% 
Q/Q with the QCT piece of AAPL  also down close to 30% Q/Q, while Samsung was 
up ~70% (better than normal seasonal of +40%). This left China Android down

Qualcomm Inc. 1 May 2025 ab 2

~25% - below seasonal though not outside of expectations for the quarter. See 
Figure 1Customer Concentration and QCOM China Android Revenue Analysis  for our customer/handset revenue analysis. 

� Qualcomm introduced the x85 modem which will ship in automotive, IoT, and 
Android smartphones in 2H25, as well as the Snapdragon 8 Elite and the 
Dragonwing fixed wireless access CPE SoC. Management also noted a 9%  1Q25 
share of Windows laptops over $600  in the US and top 5 EU markets (based on 
third-party market data). Mgmt believes the company is on track for $4B of 
Snapdragon PC revenue in FY29, but we skew generally cautious on QCOM's 
ability to achieve its FY29 revenue target as the Windows-on-ARM competitive 
landscape is likely to shift dramatically with additional entrants over the next 
couple of years (NVDA+MTK potentially being one example). Management also 
reiterated confidence in achieving its targets for $2B of XR, $8B of automotive, 
and $4B of industrial IoT in FY29.

� Management has not seen any slowdown of design win traction in China or share 
loss to Mediatek since the advent of trade tensions. Huawei licensing discussions 
remain ongoing with no update given.

� QCOM is now targeting 100% FCF return to shareholders. Relative to our prior 
assumption of ~55% FCF return, this implies ~$0.20 of EPS accretion for FY26 
(assuming 70%/30% repo/divs). 

� QTL appears on track with previously issued guidance that FY25 revenue would be 
consistent with FY24's ~$5.6B, though likely closer to ~$5.5B after accounting for 
the extra week in FY24, with the caveat that this does not factor in any second-
order demand destruction from tariffs. 

Read Across
Mgmt's constructive tone on industrial end markets within IoT suggests industrial is in 
the midst of a recovery, which is broadly consistent with what we have heard from 
others. QCOM's autos business continues to hold up better than peers, but we would 
not read through too much there. 

Valuation: $145 PT (unchanged)
Our PT of $145 (unchanged) is based on ~13x (unchanged) avg. C2022-2026E EPS of 
$10.93 (from $10.95).

KEY DEFINITIONS: Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over 
the next 12 months. In some cases, this yield may be based on accrued dividends. Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as 
the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a forecast of, the equity risk premium). Under Review (UR) 
Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are subject to possible change in the 
near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. Short-Term Ratings reflect the expected 
near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months.

EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES: UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors

Options, structured derivative products and futures (including OTC derivatives) are not suitable for all investors. Trading in these instruments is considered risky

copy of "The Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options." You may read the document at https://www.theocc.com/publications/risks/riskchap1.jsp or ask 
your salesperson for a copy. Various theoretical explanations of the risks associated with these instruments have been published. Supporting documentation for 
any claims, comparisons, recommendations, statistics or other technical data will be supplied upon request. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of 
future results. Transaction costs may be significant in option strategies calling for multiple purchases and sales of options, such as spreads and straddles. Because 
of the importance of tax considerations to many options transactions, the investor considering options should consult with his/her tax advisor as to how taxes 
affect the outcome of contemplated options transactions.
Mortgage and asset-backed securities may involve a high degree of risk and may be highly volatile in response to fluctuations in interest rates or other market 
conditions. Foreign currency rates of exchange may adversely affect the value, price or income of any security or related instrument referred to in the document. 
For investment advice, trade execution or other enquiries, clients should contact their local sales representative.

damage arising out of the use of all or any of the Information.

investment and seek individualized advice from his or her personal financial, legal, tax and other professional advisors that takes into account all the particular 
facts and circumstances of his or her investment objectives.

Investing in structured investments involves significant risks. For a detailed discussion of the risks involved in investing in any particular structured investment, you must read 
the relevant offering materials for that investment. Structured investments are unsecured obligations of a particular issuer with returns linked to the performance of an 
underlying asset. Depending on the terms of the investment, investors could lose all or a substantial portion of their investment based on the performance of the underlying 
asset. Investors could also lose their entire investment if the issuer becomes insolvent. UBS does not guarantee in any way the obligations or the financial condition of any 
issuer or the accuracy of any financial information provided by any issuer. Structured investments are not traditional investments and investing in a structured investment is 
not equivalent to investing directly in the underlying asset. Structured investments may have limited or no liquidity, and investors should be prepared to hold their investment 
to maturity. The return of structured investments may be limited by a maximum gain, participation rate or other feature. Structured investments may include call features and, 
if a structured investment is called early, investors would not earn any further return and may not be able to reinvest in similar investments with similar terms. Structured 
investments include costs and fees which are generally embedded in the price of the investment. The tax treatment of a structured investment may be complex and may differ 
from a direct investment in the underlying asset. UBS and its employees do not provide tax advice. Investors should consult their own tax advisor about their own tax situation 
before investing in any securities.

Important Information About Sustainable Investing Strategies: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and incorporate environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) factors into investment process and portfolio construction. Strategies across geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. 
Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio manager’s ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise 
would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing 
considerations may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered by the portfolio manager, and the 
investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ.

Within the past 12 months UBS Switzerland AG, its affiliates or subsidiaries may have received or provided investment services and activities or ancillary services as per MiFID 
II which may have given rise to a payment or promise of a payment in relation to these services from or to this company.
