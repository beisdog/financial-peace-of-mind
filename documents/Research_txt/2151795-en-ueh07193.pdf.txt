May '25 Edition: Demand pull-in in 2Q, low 
2H25 visibility 

Maintaining DDR contract pricing forecasts, lowering NAND a touch 
2Q25 guidance from Samsung and SK Hynix reflects some degree of demand pull-in, in 
particular from smartphone and PC customers. Both Samsung and SK Hynix guided for 
2Q25 DRAM bit growth in the low teens % QoQ. For NAND, Samsung indicated mid 
teens % bit growth QoQ in 2Q, and SK Hynix over 20%. Regarding contract pricing, we 
maintain our forecast for DDR contract pricing to increase 5% QoQ in 2Q25, with 
LPDDR5 sustaining stronger momentum relative to DDR5 and DDR4/LPDDR4. For NAND 
contract ASPs, we lower our forecast for 2Q to +3% QoQ growth (was +5%). While 
momentum remains relatively positive for embedded NAND flash, SSD price increases 
are meeting more pushback from customers. Regarding 2H25, memory vendors have 
lower-than-normal visibility considering tariff uncertainty. We continue to see NAND 
flash demand as more likely to face de-specing (or arbitraging down to lower content by 
customers - essentially the same thing). Hence we forecast NAND contract pricing down 
3% QoQ in 3Q25, before possibly stabilising in 2Q26. As for DDR, we forecast contract 
pricing up 2% QoQ in 3Q25 before coming down 5% QoQ in 4Q25, and also stabilising 
by 2Q26. 

Memory inventories down at customers, still on high side for NAND at suppliers 
Customers' memory inventories have come down somewhat faster than expected as 
demand pull-in started in 1Q25. We estimate that for DRAM, inventories at smartphone 
customers stand at 10 weeks, 12 weeks for PC OEMs, and 13 weeks for hyperscalers. 
For NAND flash, we estimate  inventories at smartphone OEMs are c. 9 weeks, and 11 
weeks for SSDs. Finished products inventories though appears to be uneven. NAND flash 
finished product inventories stood at 10.5 weeks at SK Hynix at the end of March 
(forward), 7.5 weeks at Samsung. As for DRAM, Samsung's finished product inventories 
were also 7.5 weeks, while for SK Hynix they stood at 5.5 weeks (incl .HBM), although at 
a very low 2 weeks for DDR5.

Revising down HBM bit demand  foecasts by 5% for 2025 and 2026 combined 
We recently revised down our CoWoS capacity forecasts at TSMC to 70k wpm end of 
'25, and 100k end of '26E (see note from Sunny Lin: link). We also adjusted down 
slightly our Nvidia AI accelerator estimates (see note from Tim Arcuri: link). On the back 
of this, we slightly revise down our HBM bit end-demand forecast to 18.9bn Gb in 2025 
(was  20.3bn), or +105% YoY growth. For 2026, we lower our estimate to 29.1bn (was 
30.3bn) or 54% up YoY. We expect demand from ASIC vendors to outgrow the GPU 
segment, which could lead ASICs to account for 54% of total HBM bit demand in 2026, 
vs. 41% in 2025, and Nvidia 40% vs. 52% in 2025. 

SK Hynix and MU remain our top picks within Memory 
Tariff-related uncertainty regarding 2H25 and 2026 end-demand is set to remain an 
overhang for now. But supply growth remains limited, and memory stocks have already 
de-rated to a fair degree. We continue to prefer SK Hynix and MU over Samsung and 
Nanya Tech (all Buy-rated).

Figure 34: DRAM signposts

WHAT WE EXPECT

1Q25 l DRAM inventory levels DDR5 inventories are now low

We estimate that customer inventories for DRAM are c. 10 weeks for smartphone OEMs,

12 weeks for PC OEMs, 13 weeks for hyperscale customers. Samsung DRAM finished

products inventory days stood at 7.5 weeks the end of March, and for SK Hynix, forward

finished products inventories were 5.5 weeks (incl. HBM). We believe SK Hynix' DDR5

inventories are now 2 weeks only.

2025-26 l Supply outlook Supply dynamics supportive 

Stripping out HBM, we forecast DDR bit shipments in 2025 to grow c. 11% YoY. This will

be insufficient to meet DDR demand during the course of 2025. This in part due to DRAM

industry capacity allocated to DDR only modestly increasing in 2025 to 1.52m wpm (in

4Q25E) from 1.49m in 4Q24, to then come down to 1.47m by 4Q26E. So far, DRAM capex

indications for 2025 are not suggesting a meaningful step up. 

2025-26 l HBM HBM demand forecasts coming down slightly

We forecast HBM bit demand to reach 18.9bn Gb in 2025, up 105% YoY, and 29.1bn in

2026, up 54% YoY. The delays in volume shipments of B200/GB200 servers do not seem

to have materially affected HBM3E 8-Hi demand in the near term. SK Hynix started

shipping HBM3E 12-Hi to Nvidia in 4Q24, well ahead of the expected ramp of the

B300/GB300 from 3Q25 onwards. We expect Micron to start shipping to Nvidia in

April/May. Samsung HBM4E 12 Hi re-design was completed in February, which may lead to

qualification at key customers in 2Q25. As for HBM4, SK Hynix is expected to start

production in early 3Q25, Samsung by 4Q25.

2025-26 l Server DRAM demand Conventional server DRAM demand remains steady

(DDR only - 30% of total bit 

demand in 2025E)

We forecast server units up 5% YoY in 2025 and 3% in 2026. We forecast server DDR

demand to grow 21% YoY in 2025, and 19% in 2026. Once hyperscalers start to re-

accelerate builds, we expect server DDR5 procurement to start to recover.

2025-26 l Mobile DRAM demand Edge AI to gradually help mobile DRAM content growth

(28% of total bit demand in 

2025E)

We forecast mobile DRAM bit end demand growth to be 12% YoY in 2025 and 10% in

2026. We forecast smartphone units to be up 1% YoY in 2025 and flat in 2026. We have

factored in a gradual spec-ing up of mid to high end smartphones to allow for edge gen

AI. This leads us to forecast smartphone DRAM content to move up from 7.2GB in '24, to

8.0GB in '25E and 9.0GB in '26E. We expect the iPhone 17 Pro/Pro Max to move to 12GB,

and the other models to remain at 8GB, while several Android phones will use 16GB.

2025-26 l China DRAM industry CXMT's competitive threat may be overstated 

build-up CXMT's production capacity reached 170k wpm end of 2024, and should be close to 230k

wpm end of '25. So far it has competed in the DDR4 market (19nm) and is now sampling

to customers DDR5 (16nm). The density should not be comparable to incumbents' products

- most of them using sub 15nm process tech. In addition, the ability of CXMT to ship DDR5

in volumes will depend upon its ability to ramp 16nm production, which in turn, could be

negatively affected by export controls.

Figure 35: NAND Flash signposts

WHAT WE EXPECT

1Q25 l NAND inventory levels NAND inventories have come down at customers, on the high side at suppliers 

We estimate customers' NAND flash inventories are at 11 weeks for SSDs, 9 weeks at

smartphone customers. Samsung's inventories of finished products were 7.5 weeks end of

March and SK Hynix 10.5 weeks (forward).

2025-26 l Supply outlook NAND manufacturers have swiftly cut down production this time 

We do not see any evidence of wafer capacity addition (bar YMTC) in 2025. We believe

Samsung pushed out NAND wafer capacity addition in P4. We note though that as

Samsung converts the Xi'an fabs and P1 to 236L from 128L, its net wafer capacity will

decline from a peak of 650k wpm in 1Q23 to 435k end of '25E. In addition, NAND flash

makers started reducing production from December '24 onwards, including Samsung. This

should help supply / demand in balance by 2Q25E. We expect those cuts to continue for

longer consider end-demand uncertainty on the back of tariffs. 

2025-26 l NAND flash demand Enterprise SSD demand may start to recover in 2Q25

We forecast enterprise SSD bit demand to grow 20% YoY in 2025 and 28% in 2026. In the

near term, enterprise SSD demand started to soften late 2024. Our industry checks point to

a recovery starting at the earliest in 2Q25. Longer term, near-line SSD storage continues to

be supported by AI inference deployment, and server SSD by the need to bring in NAND on

AI servers for training larger LLMs. We are less positive on client (PC) SSD and mobile NAND

demand, as growth in local storage is not a top priority for OEMs.

2025-26 l China's NAND flash build up YMTC continues to gradually add capacity 

YMTC has been facing the US restrictions for 128L equipment as well as servicing of the

installed base, as it is on the Entity List. It is ramping 160L with a process flow reportedly not

using US semis manufacturing equipment. But by doing so, production yields are we believe

challenging. Total production wafer capacity was 130k wpm end of '24, and should reach

160k end of '25E.

Valuation Method and Risk Statement

Investing in the technology sector involves a high degree of risk. Rapid technological changes, 
increasing competition and exposure to macroeconomic cycles are among the many risks 
faced by investors in technology stocks. Moreover, it is extremely difficult to project the 
financial results of tech companies since their operating models are highly volatile and 
unpredictable. Finally, valuing technology stocks can prove challenging, as neither traditional 
nor non-traditional valuation measures have provided much insight into how these stocks 
trade.

Samsung: Roughly 1/3 of Samsung’s operating profit comes from mobile phones directly (and 
more indirectly for components) where we see revenue growth for the industry decelerating 
as the smartphone market starts to mature. The industry is characterized by product cycles, 
intense competition and requires significant scale and ongoing expenses for marketing/ 
promotional activities. Some of its divisions (Memory and Display Panels) operate in industries 
which are cyclical and characterized by fluctuations in supply, demand and capital spending. 
Both industries have commodity-like features – although it is to be noted that the DRAM 
industry is now operating with significantly fewer players than before. Whilst overall cyclical 
risks have decreased longer term for DRAM (our "Goldilocks scenario"), cyclical corrections 
will likely occur. Consumer exposure overall at Samsung is universally high across products, 
although well balanced in terms of geographies. Strength in the Korean Won vs. major 
currencies can penalize earnings. Being a large component of the KOSPI, Samsung faces 
country risks as well indirectly. Corporate governance risks re the Samsung group center 
around some degree of opacity in decision-making, and limited consideration for shareholder 
returns (this may change). On the flipside, Samsung Electronics is the "crown jewel" of the 
group and its interests tend to supersede those of other Samsung companies. We value 
Samsung Electronics ordinary shares at 1.04x NTM P/BV on the back of a LT ROE average 
forecast of 8.9% and CoE of 8.5%. Our GDR price target comes from using a conversion ratio 
of 25 from Samsung Electronics common shares (005930.KS) and USD/KRW FX1434.

SK Hynix: Whilst overall cyclical risks have decreased longer term for DRAM (our "Goldilocks 
scenario"), amidst significant consolidation (3 players, from 15 in 1998) and lower growth, 
cyclical corrections will still occur as the sector retains commodity-like characteristics. The 
NAND flash industry structure has not changed as dramatically, but the coming rollout of 3D 
NAND flash manufacturing is restraining the players' willingness to add large increments of 
capacity at 2D. That being said, both segments are sensitive in particular to smartphones/
tablets demand, mix within those segments, and to a lesser extent enterprise spend 
(enterprise solid state drives, servers). The industry also remains capital-intensive, and with 
contract prices negotiated every 2 weeks to 3 months, cash flows can change quickly – so 
adequate capitalization is required. Lastly, the industry may have to move to new memory 
technologies longer term to supplement, if not replace, current silicon-based Flash and RAM 
memory structures. We value SK Hynix with a target price-to-book multiple based on long-
term average ROE vs. cost of equities.

Micron: Memory industry is highly volatile. To arrive at our PT we use a valuation method 
solely  based on P/TBV. Memory has been fairly correlated to global GDP. Therefore from a 
macro perspective there could be potential downside to our PT should economic conditions 
worsen and leading to demand destruction. Should ASP declines be more severe than our 
expectations, there could be more downside in the stock. Scaling both DRAM and NAND is 
highly complex and risks on the Technology front abound. There could be further downside 
should technology migration be slower than we expect. On the upside, while we expect ASPs 
to decline on account of incremental supply addition, any delays to the timelines could 
moderate the growth of supply and create an upward bias to ASPs and MU. Other risks 
include a faster than expected adoption of AI driving up memory content in servers and cars.

Nanya Tech: We have a Buy rating and NT$50 price target based on 1.0x 2025 P/B (vs. its 1-2x 
P/B range). Our target multiple is below its recent peak of 1.8x as we see the upcycle re-rating 
catalyst is partially offset by China competition concern. Downside risks: slower than 
expected memory pricing recovery, aggressive China expansion.

KEY DEFINITIONS: Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over 
the next 12 months. In some cases, this yield may be based on accrued dividends. Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as 
the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a forecast of, the equity risk premium). Under Review (UR) 
Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are subject to possible change in the 
near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. Short-Term Ratings reflect the expected 
near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months.

EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES: UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors 
such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Sell: Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. Core 
Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review Consultation (IRC). 
Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's debt. As a result, stocks 
deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rating. When such exceptions apply, 
they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.

future results. Transaction costs may be significant in option strategies calling for multiple purchases and sales of options, such as spreads and straddles. Because 
of the importance of tax considerations to many options transactions, the investor considering options should consult with his/her tax advisor as to how taxes 
affect the outcome of contemplated options transactions.

liquidity provider (in accordance with the interpretation of these terms in the UK) in the financial instruments of the issuer save that where the activity of liquidity provider is 
carried out in accordance with the definition given to it by the laws and regulations of any other EU jurisdictions, such information is separately disclosed in this document. 
For financial instruments admitted to trading on a non-EU regulated market: UBS may act as a market maker save that where this activity is carried out in the US in accordance

Investing in structured investments involves significant risks. For a detailed discussion of the risks involved in investing in any particular structured investment, you must read 
the relevant offering materials for that investment. Structured investments are unsecured obligations of a particular issuer with returns linked to the performance of an 
underlying asset. Depending on the terms of the investment, investors could lose all or a substantial portion of their investment based on the performance of the underlying 
asset. Investors could also lose their entire investment if the issuer becomes insolvent. UBS does not guarantee in any way the obligations or the financial condition of any 
issuer or the accuracy of any financial information provided by any issuer. Structured investments are not traditional investments and investing in a structured investment is 
not equivalent to investing directly in the underlying asset. Structured investments may have limited or no liquidity, and investors should be prepared to hold their investment 
to maturity. The return of structured investments may be limited by a maximum gain, participation rate or other feature. Structured investments may include call features and, 
if a structured investment is called early, investors would not earn any further return and may not be able to reinvest in similar investments with similar terms. Structured 
investments include costs and fees which are generally embedded in the price of the investment. The tax treatment of a structured investment may be complex and may differ 
from a direct investment in the underlying asset. UBS and its employees do not provide tax advice. Investors should consult their own tax advisor about their own tax situation 
before investing in any securities.

Important Information About Sustainable Investing Strategies: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and incorporate environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) factors into investment process and portfolio construction. Strategies across geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. 
Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio manager’s ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise 
would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing 
considerations may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered by the portfolio manager, and the 
investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ.

Within the past 12 months UBS Switzerland AG, its affiliates or subsidiaries may have received or provided investment services and activities or ancillary services as per MiFID 
II which may have given rise to a payment or promise of a payment in relation to these services from or to this company.
