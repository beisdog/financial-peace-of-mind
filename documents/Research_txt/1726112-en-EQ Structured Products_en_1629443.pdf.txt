Investors may want to focus on alternative strategies for yield generation such as put-writing strategies on
select IT stocks can consider the Autocall BRC on Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon.

Are you worried about having too much cash sitting on the side while not earning yield on it? There is a way to earn yield
with defensive equity exposure - for example on select Technology companies.

Global tech companies have recently reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings overall, underlining the resilient
growth profile of the industry. While the UBS Chief Investment Office (CIO) expects near-term volatility to continue, CIO
believes the secular AI trend will drive tech stocks higher. Investors can consider the Autocall BRC on worst-of Microsoft,
Alphabet, Amazon.
How does it work?
• Investors get a coupon payment of 10,50% in any scenario.

• The redemption will be 100% of nominal value if no barrier of [55-60]% is touched or breached.

• The early redemption feature provides a cash-out opportunity at regular intervals.

• The product outperforms direct investment in stable markets.

• The 1-year USD product is issued by UBS and is available until 09.07.2025 (ISIN: CH1457746340 <- now tradable in
UBS Mobile & e-Banking**).

Main risks at a glance
• Return limited to the coupon payment.



For UBS Marketing purposes

• Redemption potentially linked to the worst performing underlying if at least one of the barriers is touched or
breached.

• In the event of an early redemption you might not be able to invest the redemption amount at the same conditions
(reinvestment risk).

• Investors are fully exposed to the default risk of the issuer / guarantor. In the worst case, a default of the issuer /
guarantor can lead to a loss of the entire invested capital.
