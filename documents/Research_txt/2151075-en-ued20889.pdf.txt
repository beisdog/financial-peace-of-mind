Equinix Inc
Ahead of plan out of the gate 

Guidance raised due to FX, cost control; Funnel remains strong
Equinix reported solid results with in-line revenues and stronger AFFO/sh. Mgmt 
increased '25 revenue guidance ~2%, largely on better FX (now 5-6% growth in '25E; 
prior UBSe 4.9%), and continues to expect 7-8% core growth for year (ex FX, lower 
power pass through revs, Metal). The pipeline remains strong and mgmt stated April 
bookings are keeping pace with targets for accelerating recurring revenue growth 
despite tariff/macro concerns. Mgmt continues to expect ~50% EBITDA margins in 
2H25 and raised full year AFFO/sh guidance ~2% given FX and stronger 1Q 
results (UBSe +9.0% in '25E; prior 8.4%). 

1Q profits ahead; Cabinet adds impacted by churn in APAC and EMEA
Results in 1Q benefitted from better FX and cost control. Total revenues of $2.23B (in-
line w/ UBSe, Street $2.22B) grew 7% y/y on CC  vs. 6% in 4Q. EBITDA increased 9% y/y 
in CC to $1.07B (UBSe $1.05B, Street $1.04B) with lower utility costs and timing of 
spend. This drove AFFO/sh of $9.67 (UBSe $9.15, Street $9.02), also up 9%. Cabinet 
billings increased by just 300 (UBSe 2.6K; 2.2K in 4Q) as strength in the Americas was 
offset by churn events in EMEA and Apac. For 2Q, mgmt. suggested some flow through 
from churn/customer bankruptcies but guided to a ~$37M seq increase in CC recurring 
revenues (vs. $27M in 1Q). This will be offset by a similar reduction in non-recurring revs 
as xScale fees fall off (UBSe $2.26B of 2Q revs; prior $2.27B).  Given bookings 
momentum and higher conversion rates, mgmt was confident in its prior plan for 
recurring revenue step-ups for the balance of the year. 

Cross connect adds moderate; Higher capex for '25
Interconnection revenues of $393M (UBSe $400M, Street $395M) grew 9% y/y on CC, 
in-line with 4Q. Mgmt suggested strong gross add activity but cross connect net adds of 
3.9K (UBSe 5.4K) fell from 6.0K in 4Q and 6.2K a year ago. We still look for 21K adds in 
'25E (prior 22K), supporting 8.5% interconnection revenue growth. Development capex 
guidance was increased ~6% to $3.2-3.4B on FX, accelerated build plans and new 
projects (including the shift to fewer, larger campuses).  xScale leasing was modest (~2 
MWs in 1Q) and mgmt noted a strong funnel of opportunities as progress on xScale 2.0 
and the Atlanta campus continues.

Valuation: Buy rated
While more exposed to broader macro trends w/ the retail model, we remain 
constructive given the improved outlook for recurring revenues, margin upside and 
contractually based growth. Price target of $1,035 is based on 24x '26E EBITDA and 26x 
AFFO/sh.

Our PT is based on equal blend of EV/EBITDA and P/AFFO. Like all real estate companies, EQIX 
is exposed to the cost and availability of capital. Our earnings estimates for EQIX are 
predicated on continued investment in a development pipeline and the lease-up of this 
pipeline. If the economy and global trade deteriorate, earnings could be at risk. Equinix 
derives a substantial portion of its earnings from international operations, exposing the 
company to regulatory, currency and political risks.

KEY DEFINITIONS: Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over 
the next 12 months. In some cases, this yield may be based on accrued dividends. Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as 
the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a forecast of, the equity risk premium). Under Review (UR) 
Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are subject to possible change in the 
near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. Short-Term Ratings reflect the expected 
near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months.

EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES: UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors 
such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Sell: Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. Core 
Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review Consultation (IRC). 
Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's debt. As a result, stocks 
deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rating. When such exceptions apply, 
they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.

copy of "The Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options." You may read the document at https://www.theocc.com/publications/risks/riskchap1.jsp or ask 
your salesperson for a copy. Various theoretical explanations of the risks associated with these instruments have been published. Supporting documentation for 
any claims, comparisons, recommendations, statistics or other technical data will be supplied upon request. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of 
future results. Transaction costs may be significant in option strategies calling for multiple purchases and sales of options, such as spreads and straddles. Because 
of the importance of tax considerations to many options transactions, the investor considering options should consult with his/her tax advisor as to how taxes 
affect the outcome of contemplated options transactions.
Mortgage and asset-backed securities may involve a high degree of risk and may be highly volatile in response to fluctuations in interest rates or other market 
conditions. Foreign currency rates of exchange may adversely affect the value, price or income of any security or related instrument referred to in the document. 
For investment advice, trade execution or other enquiries, clients should contact their local sales representative.

damage arising out of the use of all or any of the Information.

buying or selling an option, and for the complete risks relating to options, you must receive a copy of "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options". You may read the 
document at  https://www.theocc.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp  or ask your financial advisor for a copy.

Investing in structured investments involves significant risks. For a detailed discussion of the risks involved in investing in any particular structured investment, you must read 
the relevant offering materials for that investment. Structured investments are unsecured obligations of a particular issuer with returns linked to the performance of an 
underlying asset. Depending on the terms of the investment, investors could lose all or a substantial portion of their investment based on the performance of the underlying 
asset. Investors could also lose their entire investment if the issuer becomes insolvent. UBS does not guarantee in any way the obligations or the financial condition of any 
issuer or the accuracy of any financial information provided by any issuer. Structured investments are not traditional investments and investing in a structured investment is 
not equivalent to investing directly in the underlying asset. Structured investments may have limited or no liquidity, and investors should be prepared to hold their investment 
to maturity. The return of structured investments may be limited by a maximum gain, participation rate or other feature. Structured investments may include call features and, 
if a structured investment is called early, investors would not earn any further return and may not be able to reinvest in similar investments with similar terms. Structured 
investments include costs and fees which are generally embedded in the price of the investment. The tax treatment of a structured investment may be complex and may differ 
from a direct investment in the underlying asset. UBS and its employees do not provide tax advice. Investors should consult their own tax advisor about their own tax situation 
before investing in any securities.

Important Information About Sustainable Investing Strategies: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and incorporate environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) factors into investment process and portfolio construction. Strategies across geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. 
Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio manager’s ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise 
would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing 
considerations may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered by the portfolio manager, and the 
investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ.
