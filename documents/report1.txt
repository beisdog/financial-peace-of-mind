Admirable Acquisitions and Achievable  Targets

Bottom Line
Following a Q1 beat and what appear more than achievable targets, we expect CWAN 
stock to be paced by investor confidence in integration of $1.5b Enfusion, $560m 
Beacon [both closed Apr-25] and $125m Bistro  deals and confidence in  consolidated 
2025 guide. Clearwater offered a purposeful three-phase integration strategy and 
expressed  confidence in 20% revenue growth while expanding margins—targeting 
+50bps gross margin and +200bps adj. EBITDA margin—annually. This could be 
achieved by  reaccelerating Enfusion revenue growth  to 20% in two years from ~13% 
today amid cross-selling  to Clearwater's ~1.5k client base and  synergies. First G&A and  
additional efficiencies as  a comprehensive  platform is further integrated and go to 
market strategy unified between Clearwater and the acquisitions. Our consolidated   
estimates suggest neutral 2025 EPS impact and 2026 accretion, as we remain  
constructive on its end-to-end  aspirations. While we monitor execution risk from 
multiple integrations, our confidence rests with top tier management  and opportunistic 
transactions  creating  front-to-back capabilities serving private/public assets across 
various geographies—remain Buy with unchanged $35 price target.

Company Description

Clearwater Analytics Holdings, Inc. is the leading provider of investment portfolio accounting 
SaaS software for reporting, reconciliation, and analytics services for institutional investors. Its 
products include automated data aggregation and validation, investment accounting, and 
integrated reporting tools. The company was founded in 2004 by David Boren, Michael

Valuation Method and Risk Statement

Valuation 2 year multiple based on FY27 estimates, rolled forward by Cost of Equity to derive 
1 year price target. Its growth, margin structure, TAM, and retention outpace enterprise/SaaS 
comps. An above-average peer group multiple looks fair, in our view, as growth and margins 
outpace peers on cloud-native, multi-tenant SaaS offering. Limited history since IPO was in 
2021. Risks—competition, execution with existing clients, M&A.

KEY DEFINITIONS: Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over 
the next 12 months. In some cases, this yield may be based on accrued dividends. Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as 
the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a forecast of, the equity risk premium). Under Review (UR) 
Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are subject to possible change in the 
near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. Short-Term Ratings reflect the expected 
near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months.

EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES: UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors 
such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Sell: Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. Core 
Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review Consultation (IRC). 
Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's debt. As a result, stocks 
deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rating. When such exceptions apply, 
they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.
